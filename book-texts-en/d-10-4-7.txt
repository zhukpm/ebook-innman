Timeliness of information. means that the information reaches the user in sufficient time to enable a management decision to be made (without the risk of obsolescence). The timeliness and speed with which information reaches the user is the most important characteristic of its value. As new data becomes available, information loses its usefulness and becomes of little, if not no use at all.
