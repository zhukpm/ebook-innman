The development of the scientific and technical policy of an innovation organization is based on the "five pillars" that are the sources of innovation:
- exploratory and fundamental researches;
- applied researches;
- technical developments (design and experimental, technological, project and organizational) and pilot-line production;
- assimilation of innovations;
- replication and dissemination of innovations.
Exploratory researches aims to identify opportunities for creating innovative products and technologies, materials with new properties, and management novations. Most important are fundamental researches, which able to become a generator of ideas that allow us to penetrate into still unknown areas of scientific and technical activity.
Applied researches includes researches in the field of practical application of already discovered phenomena and processes. The essence of this work is to solve technical problems that help to increase and refine the knowledge needed to find certain final results that can be used in the future in the innovation activity of the organization.
Technical developments consist of design and experimental, technological, project and organizational works culminating in the creation of a pilot-line production. The possibility degree of obtaining the desired results from previously performed theoretical studies is checked. Developments are related to the creation of prototypes (unique models with principal features), new materials, products or devices, the introduction of new processes, systems and services, or significant improvements to existing ones, their testing during the time required to obtain technical and other data and gain experience, that should later be reflected in the technical documentation on the application of innovations.
This is followed by the first assimilation of innovations â€” technical and economic. The results of innovations to the state of consumer readiness are distributed to all interested industries (organizations). They can be used in scientific institutions, in experimental samples and laboratory processes, in pilot-line productions, and, of course, in real practice. In short, where there is a demand for them and enough funds to purchase them. 
The final stage is replication and dissemination of innovations. Since it is rather complex and cumbersome, it is preferable to implement innovation activities through a planning system. At the same time, it is important that researchers, developers, designers, technologists, design organizations, manufacturers of rationalization tools, economists, and expected producers cooperate and consult closely with consumers at an early stage of documentation preparation. Only joint efforts can be made to find solutions and accord the implementation of tasks on the content and timing of innovation realizing.
It is very important to have constantly updated information about the dynamics and scientific and technical sources of innovation in order to plan the organization's innovation activities, select the most rational ways to apply innovations, and continuously monitor and enrich the innovation portfolio. The availability of such an information base is a necessary prerequisite for developing a project for technical re-equipment of an organization based on a system of business plans for investment projects containing control figures for payback and profitability.
Management structures of the innovative economy are designed to develop comprehensive concepts of scientific and technological development based on new knowledge and intellectual labor. The main universal components of such concepts are:
- state regulation of innovation activity in the innovation sphere, continuous improvement of its knowledge intensity;
- forming and realizing of federal scientific and scientific-technical programs and projects, as well as identification of federal executive authorities responsible for their implementation;
- concentration of state resources on the creation and dissemination of basis innovations that ensure progressive structural changes in the economy;
- choosing priority directions for the development of science and technology in the country;
- support of scientific researches by all possible means;
- financing of scientific and scientific-technical activities at the expense of the state budget;
- development of criteria and evaluation of results of innovation activity;
- improvement of organizational and other methods of scientific and technical development management;
- state protection of the rights and interests of the subjects of innovation activity and the intellectual property which creates in the course of innovation activity;
- license and patent law, patenting, accessibility of patent information;
- supporting for the regulation (legal, financial, technical, etc.);
- improvement of motivation systems for scientific and technical development;
- forming of prerequisites for the development of market relations in the field of innovation and suppression of unfair competition in the process of innovation activity;
- creating of a favorable investment climate in the implementation of innovation activity.
It is also necessary to develop in advance a system of social standards that regulate the requirements for new technologies, techniques and designed machines in terms of conditions, content and creative nature of work. To implement social guarantees, it is necessary to create a mechanism for retraining personnel who are released as a result of the introduction of scientific and technological progress.
The results of innovation activity are numerous and diverse in themselves. The level of resource saving increases, labor productivity and capital productivity increase, material intensity, energy intensity and capital intensity of products decrease, and significant changes occur in the structure of the national economy and innovative organizations themselves. New technological systems that ensure environmental cleanliness and safety of production are spreading faster.
