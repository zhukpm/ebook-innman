Strategies for selecting innovations are crucial in implementing innovation plan-projects, and programs, as well as in general innovation policy. The foundation for building an organization's development strategy, the starting point in this process should be an analysis of the external and internal environment, which will provide the basis for the final determination of the organization's innovation goals.
It is advisable to transfer the functions of developing an organization's innovation strategy to its innovation division. After studying the results of the environment analysis, the innovation division should set the goals of the enterprise's innovation strategy. Each goal, depending on the scale and complexity of the problem, determines the emergence of one or more innovation processes aimed at achieving it. Innovation policy should serve as the foundation for building an organization's development strategy.
Planning of innovation strategies is the most important component of management, which is necessary for achieving the long-term basic goals of the organization, allocating and using resources, improving (changing) its organizational structure, and making innovation decisions.
It is important to understand the main areas of developing an organization's behavior strategy. As such, you can select:
- new markets and concentration of efforts on a limited market segment;
- specialization in the production of products or technologies, development of new products and services, improvement of service for consumers;
- expanding opportunities to improve product quality;
- increasing the level of capitalization, increase the return on investment, profit, etc.;
- achieving leadership in a specific area of innovation activity (for example, in minimizing production costs).
Each type of innovation strategy is associated with a complex pre-development. Thus, the problem of developing high-tech industries should be considered in line with the achievements of leading scientific organizations or industrial enterprises, regional centers of science and high technologies (in the relevant industry areas).
A company's leadership can be achieved by entering the market with a principal and patented invention. In some cases, the leading position of the organization is achieved by selling products in combination with related services (according to the strategy of "complex sale").
The following types of strategies are considered innovation:
- offensive — innovations focused on gaining space in the market;
- imitative — acquisition of new technologies (products) under a license;
- traditional — improving product quality;
- opportunistic — mastering of a strategic product with relatively low research and development costs;
- defensive — does not allowing lagging behind competitors in technical and technological development.
