Basic functions of innovation management. types of activity, inherent in all organizations, without them it is impossible their effective functioning. There are private and specific functions, necessity of which depends on peculiarities of organization (its affiliation, purpose, ownership form, size, etc.). The innovative organization, as any other, carries out general functions of analysis, forecasting, planning, organization, motivation, adaptation, coordination, account, control and estimation. All of them in aggregate make up functional structure of innovative management.
Function of the analysis - the cognitive activity of the head or pro-professional work of analytical services of organizations. There are different methods of analysis. The most common methods are comparative analysis, factor analysis and economic-mathematical methods. Comparative analysis reveals the differences among comparable objects of the innovations. The method of factor analysis is characterized by the fact that it is based on determining the level of influence of specific factors on the efficiency. Economical and mathematical methods of analysis are supposed to select the most efficient (optimal by a given criterion) variants of economic decisions in existing (planned) conditions of activity.
Forecasting function is understood as a scientifically reasoned judgment about the possible alternative ways and timing of the development of the subject of innovation, the results of which are expressed in the forecast. Forecast serves as a pre-planning document that contains quantitative characteristics (estimates) of the object of management, the expected timing, volumes, costs, quality of work and other related indicators. All of them are probabilistic and further need to be adjusted.
