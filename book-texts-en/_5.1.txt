The level of use of the intellectual potential of an organization, as well as the possibilities of its enrichment, are largely dependent on the quality of its organizational structure. The structure should be simple and clear, have a minimum number of intermediate links in its composition, have qualified personnel focused on innovation activity, who are aware of the constant need to introduce innovations into the organizational structure itself.
To ensure that the organizational structure meets the requirements of a continuously developing innovation organization, it must create permanent conditions for the emergence of innovative ideas that contribute to the penetration of innovations into existing organizational rules and processes, and their consolidation as components of the organization's work.
Improving the management system on an innovation basis should be a constant process, a mandatory subject of the organization's strategy. There are no other ways to formulate and solve the problems of a modern organization in a qualified and rational way.
The main trends in the development of innovative organizational structures can be considered:
- the transition in the content and nature of the management activity itself, the management style from narrow functional specialization to integration;
- debureaucratization;
- reducing the number of hierarchical levels (transforming organizational structures from pyramid to flat, with a minimum number of levels between top management and direct performers).
A flexible innovation processes management system that focuses on the development of promising products and the restructuring of organizational forms of management, encourages the creation and implementation of innovations and provides end-to-end management of the innovation process (from the origin of the idea to its implementation). It provides services and departments that manage innovations, dispersed at different levels of the management hierarchy, united by an established system of interaction.
The absence of strict regulation of rights and responsibilities at each level of management should facilitate the free flow of ideas and proposals "from the bottom up", the real interest of employees at any level in discussing and developing decisions, and the implementation of a unified internal organizational policy, and without information overload of the top echelon of management.
In contrast to the vertical structure, the horizontal management structure helps to avoid irrational costs, helps to mobilize all the resources of the organization, allows you to quickly adapt to changing market requirements, and promotes the acceleration of the "research - production - sales" process.
Organizational forms of management of innovation processes are very diverse due to the extreme diversity of the innovation objects (processes), goals and activity directions of innovative organizations. They are usually represented by specialized business organizations or divisions. Let's name some of them (the most common):
- central services for the mastering of new products (departments of new products) that coordinate innovation activity;
- independent divisions that coordinate the goals and directions of technical development, plans and programs of innovation activity. They monitor the development of new products and their implementation, and consider projects for creating new products;
- design and target groups for scientific research, product development and production (independent divisions created for the integrated implementation of the innovation process from the idea to the mass production of the product);
- Research and Advanced Development departments in production divisions which searching and developing of new promising ideas up to the stage of mastering and production;
- venture divisions organized in large companies based on "risk capital" funds. Venture capital funds are often invested in small start-up firms that are later absorbed by large ones, or long-term links are established with them;
- specialized centralized innovation incentive funds that are created at the expense of a portion of the firm's profit. They are used to accelerate the introduction of new products into mass production; development centers are independent divisions that are not related to the main field of activity of the organization. For them, such indicators of economic activity are established that at the stage of introducing new products stimulate the expansion of sales and help to gain market positions;
- funds to encourage innovation in production units. They are created to encourage Research and Advanced Development with applicable nature;
- consulting and analytical groups whose functions include forecasting technology development and demand for new products, selecting promising ideas, defining research topics and coordinating work;
- temporary target groups for integrated solutions to innovation problems;
- venture groups;
- engineering firms and others.
There are various forms of scientific and technical cooperation in innovation between organizations.
Joint scientific research and design developments aimed at solving certain scientific, technical and production problems (for example, cooperation on a commercial basis to reduce costs or improve product quality).
Joint works for the implementation of a certain scientific, technical or industrial cooperation program by joint efforts. The subject of cooperation is research that promises certain innovative solutions, development of product innovations, exchange of technologies of manufactured products, participation in the implementation of the life cycle of the organization (product). As a contribution to the authorized capital, the cooperating parties can make their own inventions, "know-how" and other scientific and technical developments.
Production cooperation in the field of industrial and technical relations between independent organizations. Cooperation is based on an innovative technology of one of the partners that contains "know-how" and is protected by patents. The desired technology can be purchased from a third party (participant) of the cooperation.
Construction of a "turnkey" enterprise is a form of exchange (implementation) of an innovative product (technology), when the transferring party assumes the responsibilities of the General contractor and is responsible for the entire construction cycle of the object, including pre-project surveys, design, licensing, supply of complete equipment, installation, commissioning, technical consulting, problems of organization and management of production.
Franchising is a form of contractual relationship that occurs between independent organizations based on trade in goods, technologies, or services. In accordance with the franchise agreement, the seller (franchisor) grants the buyer the right to use its trademark, trade name and other intellectual property objects.
Leasing â€” forms of renting of machinery and equipment, when the lessor provides the lessee with goods for exclusive use for a specified period for a certain fee on the basis of a leasing agreement. The lessor retains ownership of the product. The lessee is granted a temporary right to use the product. The agreement provides for the provision of permanent technical assistance to the lessee by the lessor (in the form of services and consultations).
Trade in scientific and technical services, the main form of which is engineering-providing on the basis of a contract a set of individual types of engineering and technical services related to research, design, construction, commissioning, development of new technological processes at the customer's enterprises (with the improvement of existing production processes). Engineering activities are divided into design-consulting, contracting and management. Engineering allows you to generalize and use scientific and technical knowledge to solve technical and production problems.
In international relations, licenses are traded as part of the scientific and technical exchange of product-innovations. Some types of cooperation are used by foreign entrepreneurs to combine technological capabilities in a single product without merging into a single Corporation. Other forms of scientific and technical cooperation in innovation are also known.
Sometimes innovation divisions create a large enterprise that needs innovative entrepreneurship as a factor of competitiveness, when the state of affairs and strategic goals require the transformation of innovation into a new business.
The activity of such innovative divisions can be aimed at solving the following tasks:
- collecting and summarizing information about innovations;
- active marketing of external and internal innovative solutions and developments;
- development of strategic programs and perspective solutions;
- planning for novations;
- control of the impact of innovations on the processes of efficiency and quality in the company's activity;
- development of a quality program;
- preparation of recommendations for adapting the production process to novations.
Own innovation divisions of intra-organizational entrepreneurship have many advantages, and first of all, they allow us to bring scientific researches closer to the capabilities of the initial production and the needs of the end user, attract highly qualified scientific personnel and be confident in preserving commercial secrets.
The innovation division should have linear links, both with the main management levels and with lower-level management levels. In functional terms, this link plays the role of a headquarters department that develops and accumulates innovations (fig. 3).

When creating an innovation division, you must assign an employee who is personally responsible for the success of innovation. He should be responsible for timely identification and replacement of outdated products, equipment, and technologies, for a comprehensive analysis of production and economic activities, and for developing innovative measures. The employee responsible for innovation activities must be sufficiently authoritative in the organization.
