Every innovative organization carries out its activities through the implementation of its inherent functions. There are many of these functions, and they are classified in a certain way. We are interested in the main (or General) functions that are inherent in all organizations, without which their activities are impossible.
There are also private and specific functions, the need for which to some extent depends on the characteristics of the organization (its industry affiliation, purpose, form of ownership, size, etc.).
In the literature, there are discrepancies in the classification of General functions, but the principle of the approach is unambiguous. An innovative organization, like any other, performs the functions of analysis, forecasting, planning, organization, motivation, adaptation, coordination, accounting, control and evaluation. All of them together form the functional structure of innovation management.
Let's give a brief description of some of the main control functions.
The quality of management elements and the relationships between them are closely related to how the analysis function is understood and performed. There are various ways to perform the analysis.
The basis of factor analysis is to determine the level of influence of specific factors on efficiency (for example, the amount of total costs), taking into account the information obtained when developing a plan of organizational and technical measures of a specific innovation orientation.
Economic and mathematical methods of analysis assume the choice of the most effective (optimal for a given criterion) options for economic decisions in the current (planned) conditions of activity. It is desirable that the analysis of implementation of managerial decisions ahead of time not only current but also potential problems, which helps to identify at what stage of innovation is likely to have problems, and how great may be their impact, as well as to find specific ways to prevent or offset the undesirable consequences of these problems.
Evaluation of work is organized based on deviations from the planned indicators with the establishment of their causes and identification of unclaimed reserves. Report indicators can be compared with planned indicators, planned indicators with indicators of the previous period, report indicators with indicators of previous periods, and so on. Before comparing indicators, you should bring them into a comparable form (unity of assessment, comparability of calendar terms, elimination of the influence of differences in volume and assortment, product quality, etc.).
The forecasting function is understood as a scientifically reasoned judgment about possible alternative ways and terms of developing the subject of innovation, the results of which are expressed in the forecast. The forecast is a pre-planned document containing quantitative characteristics (estimates) of the management object, estimated terms, volumes, costs, quality of work, and other related indicators. All of them are probabilistic and need to be adjusted in the future. The purpose of forecasting is to determine scientifically based (reliable) trends in the development of the innovation object, which will be used in the development of strategic plans in general, but primarily in the conduct of scientific-research and experimental-design works.
The main tasks of forecasting are:
- identification of trends (economic, scientific, technical) that can have an impact on meeting the needs of consumers;
- study and forecast market demand for specific types of innovation strategies, products and technologies;
- argumentation of the economic rationality of developing new products or improving the quality of producing products in accordance with the priorities of the organization and with available resources, etc.
At the planning stage, which is recognized as the most important function of management, specific and reasoned goals and objectives are defined, methods and means of their implementation are developed. The plan and forecast are mutually complementary management stages (with the plan playing a defining role). In contrast to the forecast, the plan contains no longer alternative, but unambiguous characteristics of the planned object, based on a rational forecast option.
The plan serves as the basis for the activities of innovative organizations of all forms of ownership and size, ensuring consistency in the work of their divisions, monitoring results, determining resource needs, stimulating the labor activity of employees, and analyzing the results of innovative activities.
Coordination is a function designed to ensure consistency in the activities of all related parts of the organization by establishing rational communications between them. Widely used means of communication (reports, consultations, meetings, documents, etc.) allow you to establish links and interactions between subsystems of innovation organizations, to ensure unity and harmony of all stages and functions of the management process.
Each innovation system (subsystem) — innovation-strategies, innovation - technologies and innovation-products solves its own problems.
Let's look at the main tasks of product innovations management as an example:
- study of the degree of consistency of product parameters to idea and mission of the organization;
- market research of innovative products —the nature of needs, capacity, selection of target segments (niches), technologies for promoting products to the consumer, determining how to sell the product-innovation;
- research of the resource market conjuncture, the state of the situation with competition for specialized products, risk analysis and search for ways to minimize them;
- forecasting activities in the context of the stage of the organization's life cycle (certain innovations);
- determining the feasibility and possibility of cooperation in the creation, development and placement of product innovation on the market with other competing organizations.
These functions, which are in continuous interaction in space and time, form the management cycle of the innovation management system. These functions require people who are able to find and solve the challenges of innovation strategies, products, and technologies.
