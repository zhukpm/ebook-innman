Innovation activity requires managers (employees) who have creative abilities and are able to generate original ideas. The manager responsible for the innovation project (program) is obliged to unite, inspire and direct the actions of the team.
It is very important to choose participants in innovation processes who must have broad views, be receptive to innovative ideas, be alien to stereotypes, be unbiased, and be accustomed to working in a team. Outside experts who are able and willing to provide real assistance to an innovative organization can be invited to participate in the activities of innovation groups. Of particular importance is the ability to work with enthusiasm, but calmly and without excessive stress.
At the same time, it is impossible to overestimate the role of an innovative leader who develops innovative strategies, searches for acceptable organizational forms of their implementation, and interests all staff in innovation. At one time, the desire for innovation activity of such well-known managers as Bill Gates of Microsoft, Akio Morita of Sony, Jack Welch of General Electric, led their companies to world leadership.
Promising innovative technologies have a chance to be realized only if they are managed by a staff with the appropriate intellectual potential, a culture of continuous renewal and technological breakthrough, focusing on values such as shared creativity and commitment to higher goals, and experiencing satisfaction and pride in a job well done.
There are many recommendations regarding the list of desirable qualities of a leader. All of them are fair and none of them is objectionable, rather they complement each other. As a typical example, we will refer to G. Rolland, author of the book "Time of leaders", who highlights a number of principles of a leader's activity that ensure success.
Being a leader means:
- taking on the role of "obstetrician" in relation to other people's abilities;
- learning from your mistakes;
- developing the ability to think complex and strategically;
- being able to take risks, learn new things, and clearly assess own resources;
- perceiving other ways of thinking and behaving other than your own, being able to change and adapt;
- mobilizing and organizing people in accordance with existing norms and attitudes.
In an innovation organization, nothing is more important than leadership. No single factor affects the success of an organization as much as the understanding and commitment of management to the idea of leadership, which is evaluated as the main and rare resource of the organization. With the progress of globalizing structures, the place of leaders-bosses should be replaced by leaders of a new generation — with a new way of thinking, innovative management culture and ethical values.
We also note that the analysis of leadership theories shows that none of them fully meets the requirements of an innovative organization. At the same time, it is generally recognized that authoritarian governance has been replaced (over time) by democratic governance.
In an innovative organization, there is an absolute need for democratic governance, for minimizing vertical hierarchical links, and for replacing them with horizontal links between teams and functional divisions. By eliminating hierarchical relationships and improving bottom-up relationships, managers can be transformed from supervisors to team coordinators, experts, and associates who can perform non-hierarchical organizational functions. At the same time, the defining function of the leader is seen in creating conditions in which the goals set become common and the entire team is distinguished by a high level of expectations in terms of achieving them.
The essential difference between organizations of different forms of ownership and social orientation should not be overlooked in the discussion of leadership, since the leadership features required for their effective functioning are also very specific.
Most often, organizations suffer from an excess of administrative management and a lack of leadership. And there is an explanation for this. In the past, with an excessively formalized management system and an ideologized environment, the opportunities to use the potential of leadership were limited. A peculiar understanding of performance, which excludes any freedom of action in the development of decisions ("do as you are told"), did not encourage people to think independently.
It is necessary to dramatically increase efforts to develop leadership in innovative organizations. It is important to find ways to eliminate contradictions between the leader's behavior and employees ' value expectations, so that the adopted innovative vision does not lose its appeal, and the leader does not lose confidence.
As already noted, there is no generally accepted position regarding the required qualities of an innovative leader. R. Stogdill, after reviewing more than a hundred special studies, found that none of them contained clear evidence of the essential qualities of leaders. And this is natural for many objective reasons, including the fact that at different stages of development, the team will need different types of leaders. The qualities that are recognized as the best for a particular stage can also be justified at other stages in certain situations. Yet at each stage, the dominant role of certain traits of the leader is obvious.
The following components of leadership need the most attention:

- understanding the functional purpose and direction of the organization, focusing attention and resources on getting a high result;
- concentration of efforts, first of all, on the mobilization of energy in the sphere of work, disclosure of the natural source of energy within each employee, elimination of all possible obstacles to the application of his creative forces;
- free circulation and exchange of ideas between employees and structural divisions at all stages of the team's activity, including the "research and development" stage;
- the ability of a leader to ignite enthusiasm so that employees accept a challenge that should not be too weak (then no one will strain) and not too strong (then there is no point in straining);
- establishing links between goals, work, and people, and enabling employees to decide on their own goals and tasks achieving;
- ranking problems by their importance and urgency, drawing up feasible schedules for their solution;
- rational and reasonable, psychologically justified ratio of cooperation and competition between team members;
- support for initiatives and encourage innovation activity (no matter how insignificant it may seem);
- choosing the right people and placing them according to who is capable of what;
- mastery of the art of performing the functions of a "social architect", including conflict resolution;
- explanation of the meaning of what is happening to subordinates, because those who understand the meaning of things are better guided in choosing alternatives;
- encourage the diversification of professional activities of team members in order to create the conditions for their substitution in case of functional necessity.
These variables are characteristic of a democratic leader, as opposed to managers who insist on strict compliance by employees with their instructions and at the same time "suck" creative energy out of them instead of mobilizing it.
Of the broad set of requirements for leaders, we consider the two most important ones to be particularly useful: the ability to work with followers and the ability to make decisions based on intuition.
Strengthening the leader's position in the team and his ability to communicate positively with the staff largely depend on his relationships with followers and the correct choice of means of motivating them (not spontaneously, but according to a purposeful program). But the same situation also shows the dependence of the leader on the interested and voluntary response of employees. Being a manager does not promise leadership in itself. Therefore, there is a need to find managers who understand that their behavior in all respects should be interactive, taking into account feedback from subordinates.
The management team is, therefore, an education in which innovative technologies should be introduced.
The characteristic features of an effective innovative management team can be highlighted:
- consideration of the characteristics and qualifications of each team member;
- complementarity of skills and capability to perform different role functions;
- understanding and acceptance of tasks by all team members;
- interest in the constant multiplication and possibly full realization of their creative potential;
- fast adaptation to changing conditions and requirements;
- reasonableness and satisfaction with team relationships;
- analysis of joint actions and discovering collective self-awareness and openness;
- development of alternative solutions and selection of the most appropriate one based on common agreement;
- complementarity — everyone pays attention and support to each other, marks their achievements, and openly expresses their feelings and doubts;
- search for ways to resolve emerging problems (there are no thoughts of suppressing those who hold a different position);
- respect for the opinions of your colleagues.
This approach identifies and implements existing opportunities to compensate for the qualities that some employees lack with the qualities of others, which favors their psychological compatibility and the formation of an active team. The distribution area of formal relations is narrowing in innovation management.
