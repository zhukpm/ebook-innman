At any level of economic management, it is important to rely on a well-thought-out innovation policy, which is an element of state regulation, in order to successfully solve the problems of innovative development. This policy is based on a long-term concept of innovative development of the respective economic systems. At the same time, it should always have its own social component.
Innovation policy at all levels of the economy is linked, in one way or another, to the state innovation policy. The private enterprise concepts of various government bodies, for all their legal independence, are components of a single state policy implemented in the common interest. At its core, the state innovation policy is an integral part of the socio-economic policy of the state, which presents its vision of innovation activity, its ideology, goals and objectives.
State innovation activity should have:
- clearly defined goals and management structures necessary for the implementation of the stated goals;
- the means of regulation and support, through which public authorities have an impact on organizations and the environment of their functioning;
- an information system that is required to supplement (support) the state functions of innovation activities. Priority in this policy is given to innovation activity as the most important means of ensuring technological development and competitiveness of modern production and, ultimately, improving the quality of life of the population.
State policy in the field of innovation activity is focused on the transfer of economic systems to the rails of innovative development and the creation of infrastructure that promotes the development of similar processes in private business organizations. The state innovation policy expresses the attitude of state authorities to innovation activity and its results.
The state's innovation policy is focused on solving problems of an inter-sectoral and sectoral nature that lead to a radical change in the country's technological base and require the concentration of resources on the scale of the national economy. General issues of innovation policy are reflected in the decrees of the President of the Russian Federation, which are prepared by departments of the Presidential administration, as well as the Council for scientific and technical policy under the President of the Russian Federation. The Council, an Advisory body that informs the President about the processes in scientific and technical sphere of the country and abroad developing proposals on strategy of scientific and technological policy and formation of the priority directions in its realization; carries out expertise coming to the conclusion of the President draft legislation on scientific and technical issues.
The main task of the Federal innovation policy is to create a favorable innovation climate for the materialization of state priorities for scientific and technological development in the economic sphere. The activities that form the content of innovation policy at the national level include:
- the initiation of innovative programs (projects) aimed at realizing in production the scientific and technical novelties created in the course of implementing state scientific and technical programs;
- transfer of new technologies from the public sector and state scientific and technical institutions to the production sphere;
- creation of an innovative market and its infrastructure (financial and information services system, etc.);
- coordination of innovation activity and its support at all stages of innovation processes.
There are two significantly different methods of state regulation of innovation: direct (administrative) and indirect (economic).
Administrative methods are based on a legal framework that restricts certain activities or promotes their development. The leading instrument of direct influence of the state on innovation activity is the state innovation policy. Carrying out the planning, organization and implementation of innovative programs, the state itself creates the resources for innovation activity. This is done, for example, through:
- direct state investments in the development of research and scientific design works;
- distributing budgetary and extra-budgetary resources (state orders, grants, loans) between various areas of scientific researches and developments in accordance with the system of state scientific priorities;
- the legal regulation of the state's patent policy and standardization policy.
All this allows economic entities to maintain a monopoly on novelty, achieve unification of products of commodity producers, and solve other problems.
For organizations, participation in state scientific, technical and innovative projects is a source of knowledge and experience gained through creative collaboration with universities, state laboratories and private enterprises. By fulfilling government orders, they receive financial resources from the state and access to unique scientific and technical equipment and other technological and non-technological resources available to the state.
However, economic methods of regulating organizations' innovation activity that are implemented without direct state intervention are much more effective. In this case, the state seeks the development of science and technology and the development of their achievements in the public and private sectors of the economy using: 
- tax, depreciation, patent, customs policies, as well as by supporting innovative small enterprises;
- providing various kinds of concessions to the subjects of the innovation process (as directly to entrepreneurs, innovators, and those elements of infrastructure that have them a particular support);
- creating an innovative climate in the economy and infrastructure for researches and developments, including national services for scientific and technical information, patenting, licensing, standardization, certification, preparing forecasts of scientific and technological development and forming a system of national scientific priorities based on them to provide information to authorized managers.
In general, the main goal of state regulation of the innovation sphere is seen in the formation of the basic components of the innovative type of development of all economic systems that allow us to move to mainly innovative results of reproduction activity.
These components are:
- the distribution of powers between all branches of government, all entities of economic activity, including innovation activity;
- creating economic, legal and organizational conditions for innovation activity;
- consistent development of innovation activity of the primary production level and corporate structures;
- improving the production efficiency and competitiveness of domestic producers through the creation and dissemination of basic and improving innovations;
- understanding the specifics of the tasks solved by the state in specific areas and types of society's activities;
- awareness of features of interests represented and protected by the state;
- support of domestic entrepreneurs in the processes of international division of labor in the innovative economy.
Gradual, phased transfer of economic systems at all levels to a predominantly innovative type of development will help solve such socio-economic problems as increasing the competitiveness of the national economy, and at the same time improve the social parameters of innovative organizations.
