Theory of expectations (expectations of how situations and possible outcomes of actions will be shaped in practice). According to this theory, the prerequisite for motivation to achieve a certain goal is the belief of the individual that the type of behavior will lead to the satisfaction of the desired outcome. This theory reflects the strong motivation of employee behavior at all levels of management.
