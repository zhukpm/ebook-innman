In any organization, there are many factors and conditions, the active use of which contributes to the development of innovation activity. In the totality of the factors of interest to us, the basic place is occupied by the innovation culture of the organization, which is associated with the implementation of all its innovation activity on the basis of the original values of society's development. Within the framework of innovation culture, the problems of external adaptation and internal integration of all structural divisions of the organization should be solved without losing the value orientations of development. The behavior of its employees involved in innovation activity should also be structured accordingly.
The weakness and even more so the lack of an innovation culture based on the ancestral values of the Russian people can become the main reason that the organization's activity will be aimed at achieving social goals in innovative ways that are unacceptable from the point of view of culture, which, ultimately, can lead to its destruction.
It is also desirable that the mission of the organization is based on cultural values, and its goals and future are built in line with their preservation and multiplication.
Culture is an important prerequisite for the formation of an innovation climate at the enterprise, based on the traditions of the Russian people, reflecting their desire for education, knowledge, the development of non-standard thinking, the use of natural intuitive abilities, as well as creativity and teamwork. It should be noted such qualities of the Russian people as receptivity to innovations, tolerance to others and different worldviews. Skillful use of these traditions and qualities of people in the innovation activity of the organization ensures the rapid growth of the spiritual and intellectual capital of the organization, contributes to the active increase in the number of innovations and increase their competitiveness. At the same time, a new quality of the results of innovation activity of the organization is formed, in which the social, spiritual dominates over the material, ensuring the stability of its functioning.
The culture of an innovative organization should cover its mission, which sets the meaning of the organization's existence, reflect the original values and principles of its functioning, corporate norms of relations, its atmosphere, and correspond to the strategy of achieving competitive advantages and high socio-economic efficiency based on the introduction of innovation technologies.
As you know, in the course of the development of society, the forms of organization of production and labor gradually change, management structures become more complex, small groups have a strong influence on a person, interpersonal relationships are strengthened, which often lead to conflicts. The transition to informal organizational management structures has become inevitable. The collective consciousness that influences employees began to dominate, and the influence of leaders increased.
Small groups began to create their own subcultures with an internal hierarchy, a set of norms and rules of behavior inherent in structures with informal behavior focused on non-standard, innovation thinking. Eventually, the informal organization, by its nature the most innovative, began to exert a more powerful influence on staff than the formal one. The informal organization, which has grown up on the basis of organizational culture (unwritten norms of behavior, social protection), has taken a priority position in the process of regulating the behavior of personnel and in the formation of a creative innovative microclimate.
As a result, an adequate management structure began to be built under this climate, which is organizationally and motivationally supporting:
- staff's propensity for innovation thinking;
- developing each employee sense of responsibility;
- setting clear collective goals;
- clear formulation of specific tasks for the management team;
- ensuring the conditions for successful implementation of the decisions taken.
All the efforts of the organization began to focus on creating a creative atmosphere of mutual trust, in which employees feel free and motivated, ready to materialize their knowledge in intelligent products and innovation management technologies.
Creating an organizational structure of such high quality always involves a lot of purposeful work to instill and maintain the basic values of the corporate culture. These are, in particular, corporate traditions that stem from universal values that embody the values of the culture of the multinational Russian people, which help each member of the team, brought up within the culture of their people, to realize their commonality with others. Events related to each member of the team are celebrated together, which create an informal atmosphere that brings people together. As a result, intra-organizational communications are enriched, as well as connections with the external environment, and production and social problems are solved more easily and quickly. In short, the organization creates an environment that in all its manifestations contributes to increasing trust in each other, creativity, and as a result, the development of its innovation activity.
With the intellectualization of the work that underlies innovation activity, the culture of the organization increases, which begins to be qualitatively transformed and developed under its influence. This trend increases as the means and subjects of labor change, and labor itself is transformed, becoming more complex, creative, and intellectually intensive. In the total number of personnel engaged in innovation activity, the share of intellectual workers, cultural carriers are growing. The behavior of employees is becoming more and more ethical, built on the basis of cultural traditions. Innovation activity is linked to the implementation of cultural, ethical norms, rules of conduct, including in the relations of personnel with the external environment (customers, partners), as well as with colleagues and subordinates within their own organization.
Ethical norms of business relations (as an element of culture) they become one of the most important components of the innovation activity of each employee and the organization as a whole. They contribute to the formation of the corporate culture of the organization, based on such values as love, joy, peace, long-suffering, because "there is no law on such things".
At the heart of the ethics of innovation management is the responsibility and duty of the manager in relation to employees and own functional responsibilities, a clear idea of justice and the public good, recognition of the existence of basic values of culture, moral, moral boundaries, understanding that they cannot be violated in the same way as formal laws.
Moral requirements are universal. Morality and ethics are broader concepts than law and law. Ethical norms of service relations are based on universal norms of behavior that have historically proved their objective value, including in innovative management. At the same time, it is important to understand the distinctive features, forms and methods of using ethical norms of behavior in different spheres of activity and in different ethnic groups.
In the world, there is a rapidly growing interest in the culture and values that form the basis of the life activity of successful states, including their use in innovative management in order to achieve the highest results.
In the world of globalization, without cultural, value orientations and a well-developed component of ethics, no model of innovative management can fully work for the interests of the people, preserving their inherent way of life and habitation environment. Managers of a civilized economy, taught by bitter experience, prefer to have stable business relationships with organizations and managers who recognize cultural and ethical values. Richard Bernard, vice president of the New York Stock Exchange, said: "No company can operate on the stock exchange until it proves its honesty." A company that does not comply with corporate rules is expelled from the exchange.
Now the circle of business communities concerned with the development of effective codes of corporate culture and ethical behavior (independent or as an essential part of the corporate governance system) is significantly expanding. For example, the Federal Securities Commission developed its own version of the relevant code, which was strongly recommended to Russian joint-stock companies. after that, the commission of the Russian union of industrialists and entrepreneurs on corporate ethics was established, and then the heads of three business structures ("Russian union of industrialists and entrepreneurs", " Delovaya Rossia " and " Prop of Russia") signed an agreement on partnership in resolving commercial disputes, in which ethics issues occupy a significant place.
Especially important in the code are technologies for creating and consolidating a culture of trust, this complex integrated feeling that, in particular, subordinates feel for an honest, competent, always telling the truth and fulfilling their promises to a manager who respects his employees and is inclined to delegate authority. After all, trust contains a huge potential for enriching the entire system of human relations, creating a comfortable environment in organizations and enhancing the synergistic effect.
One should distinguish between ethical intention and ethical action. The gap between the two is in corporate issues. We recommend, for example, a corporate responsibility pyramid consisting of the following components:
- economic responsibility â€” to be profitable and pay taxes in good faith (the basis of all other types of responsibility);
- legal responsibility-compliance with the letter of the law (playing by the uniform rules);
- philanthropic responsibility;
- corporate social responsibility of the state, business and society (ability to improve the quality of life).
However, the culture of different peoples is different. Quite often, even among senior staff, the concept of "culture" is perceived and interpreted in different ways, which can affect the formation of innovation management in the most unfavorable way. in particular, this is observed in the sphere of interethnic and interfaith relations.
Characteristic differences in the behavior of the organization's personnel, especially innovation ones, caused by differences in culture and ethics, must be taken into account when forming and functioning international and, especially, multiethnic teams. Otherwise, mutual understanding of the motives of activity will be difficult or impossible, which will lead to an escalation of tension within the teams. In such cases, it should be remembered that in all religions, the original values are the same and do not contradict each other. Difficulties in their understanding and use are created by the person himself, distorting values in favor of his own interests.
