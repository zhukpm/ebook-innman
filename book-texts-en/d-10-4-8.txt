Cost-effectiveness of information. the ratio of the cost of information to the results obtained from its use should be rational. Any information is costly to obtain and, as a rule, the higher the quality, the more expensive it is to collect, process and store. It is desirable that with the least amount of primary data and the least cost the information contains the maximum amount of useful information. An acceptable balance should be found between the cost and value of the information used.
