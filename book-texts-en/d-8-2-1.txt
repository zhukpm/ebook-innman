Theories of motivation (the doctrine of motivation). Internal and external theories have been developed in relation to the organization. Internal theories include the theory of needs by A. Maslow and the theory of "labor enrichment" by F. Herzberg, and external theories that develop systems of monetary incentives for effective work based on standardization of work and training personnel in methods of their implementation (a method, the basis for which was laid down by F. Taylor). In all cases, the theory's recommendations can be used to search for adequate opportunities to stimulate innovation activity. It is important that successes should be encouraged and, moreover, immediately after the work has been done.
