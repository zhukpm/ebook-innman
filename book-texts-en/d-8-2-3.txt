Maslow's theory of needs satisfaction. Human needs are divided into five categories: physiological needs (food, clothing, housing); economic security needs (high wages to save money, medical and social insurance, pension and employment guarantee schemes); social needs - a sense of belonging to a collective, desire for communication, mutual respect; Status needs - the need for recognition, a feeling of value of the person as an integral part of the whole (these needs are closely connected with the concept of status, which denotes the "importance" of man in the eyes of others); needs in self-expression - the needs of the highest order, when a person works, feeling satisfaction from the very process of work. The modern interpretation of needs satisfaction theory puts spiritual rather than physiological needs first, recognizing the metaphysical doctrine of the primacy of spirit and the secondary nature of matter.
