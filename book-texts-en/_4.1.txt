Innovation management is the activity of managing innovations (novation) — products and technologies (factors of labor efficiency) in order to obtain economic and social results of a production and commercial nature. The transition to an innovative management model is associated with changes in the traditional style of thinking and management, and implies the presence of personnel with developed abilities to innovation activity (openness, receptivity and readiness to develop and implement innovations). Innovation management is based primarily on the scientific and technical process (technique, technology, and organization) that allows you to develop and implement new products, as well as improve traditional ones.
Innovation management involves focusing staff efforts on the following priority directions:
- transformation of the production and organization's management systems on the innovation base;
- formation of innovation personnel potential;
- improvement of organizational forms of innovation activity;
- creating a system for motivating innovators;
- introduction of innovations in the gentrification of labor.
Through innovation management, the ideas of integrated use of innovations are implemented to ensure an innovative type of development of economic systems, mastering competitive advantages in a dynamic market environment.
In order to achieve high efficiency of an innovative economy, it is necessary that the ideas of innovativeness be extended to economic systems at all levels. First of all, care should be taken to create a national innovation system as a set of interrelated and complementary innovation processes. Such processes should be carried out at the level of an individual organization, which is the main object of our interests, as well as the Corporation, region and state. In all these systems, it is necessary to develop and implement novation strategies that combine the goals of technical policy and investment policy, focused on the systematic search for previously unknown technological opportunities, the introduction of new technologies and types of products.
The most important means of solving the problems that arise in this regard is innovation management, which makes it possible (through the preferential use of system scientific and technical innovations) to ensure the stability of the organization and the directed reproduction of innovative products (goods) and all the necessary conditions for this.
From the point of view of the organization, innovation management is a system consisting of two functionally different subsystems:
- "material", focused directly on the production and technological process of implementing an innovative project;
- "immaterial", the object of which is the innovations of the organizational and management mechanism.
Currently, the effect of the trend of transformation of the object of innovation management is particularly marked — from novations in the predominantly material sphere to novations in the predominantly immaterial (intellectual) sphere (management technology, its structural, financial and commercial schemes, brands, trade mark, relations with consumers, staff training, etc.).
Innovations cover both managed and control systems. However, not everything depends on the introduction of scientific and technological innovations. No less important is the efficiency of their use, which is determined by the technical and technological level of existing fixed capital, the state of demand in the market, as well as organizational and managerial efforts to transform knowledge into innovation to achieve the main goals of the organization. At the same time, it is necessary to develop practical recommendations for the implementation of management innovations. Within each organization, it is necessary to develop a strategy for implementing management innovations, determine the effectiveness of implementation, and organize training for managers to acquire knowledge and skills in the field of innovation management activity.
In the process of its creation and use, innovation managing relies on the scientific (innovative) potential of the organization, which has as its strategic goal the achievement of competitive advantages. The organization's strategy should be focused on innovative development. In this case, it looks like this (fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Strategic management process 

Strategic management activities begin with an analysis of the external and internal environment of the organization functioning. In principle, you can use planning and forecasting data here, but with the necessary caution, since the external environment is constantly changing. At the same time, it is recommended to formulate the mission of the organization, which in a concentrated form expresses the purpose (meaning) of its activity, the type of business and its socio-economic orientation, the features of products (services), the circle of regular clients (consumers). It is desirable to reflect the main value orientations of innovative business in the mission. In addition, you should give a brief description of the external environment of the organization (macro-environment), the immediate environment (micro-environment), as well as characteristic features of the inter-relations that have developed in its internal environment.
Innovation management presupposes:
- studying the processes of creating innovations, starting from the origin moment of their conception;
- development of innovation activity plans (programs) in accordance with forecasting and planning paradigms;
- coordination of all production divisions of the organization from the point of view of a systematic approach;
- provision of innovation activity projects (programs) with financial and material resources;
- provision of innovation departments with qualified personnel and forming target groups in them, as a rule, temporary for the implementation of innovation problems;
- monitoring the progress of creating a new product (technology) and its implementation.
An innovation organization must have strategic and operational independence, market positioning authority, the capability to determine the volume of production and product range, own technological and organizational structure. For sustainable development an innovation organization:
- constantly updates its products and creates new innovative production systems;
- improves the structure of its assets (mainly due to their intellectual component);
- increases the activity and creative return of its staff and reduces all types of expenses;
- concentrates its efforts and resources on more promising areas of innovation activity and develops market segments (niches) that are adequate to it;
- develops flexible organizational and structural solutions that do not leave room for unnecessary formalism and bureaucracy, which are absolutely contrary to innovative behavior.
Accordingly, all the infrastructure components necessary for the implementation of strategic and operational actions of the organization should be developing.
All innovations are, in one way or another, interconnected, but management innovations have important distinctive features. They are aimed at improving the relationship of subordination and cooperation. The impact of management novations on the results of the organization's activities is most often indirect, and therefore we should not expect a quick effect here. Successful implementation of management innovations requires understanding the specifics of such work.
Management innovations can be effectively used in almost all areas of activity (organizational structure and division of labor, organization of work of managers and specialists, control over them, organization of remuneration, material and moral incentives, development of organizational culture, and up to the formation of a good mood among employees).
