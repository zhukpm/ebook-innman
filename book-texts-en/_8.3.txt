The development of the motivational aspect of an innovation organization, the formation of a new system of values and remuneration of its personnel become powerful prerequisites for innovation activity. There is an obvious need for new approaches to the problem of motivation, given that we are talking mainly about intellectual work. It is also very important for managers to think about the interests of the shareholders of an innovation organization.
For the development of an innovation organization, the following motives can be recommended for use:
- efficiency (profitability);
- creativity (the desire to build up knowledge, implement creative ideas);
- meeting the needs of consumers (clients forming new needs;
- prestige;
- meeting special needs.
All the variety of complementary motives should be focused on specific innovations, the carriers of which are creative workers associated with the technical preparation of the production process (projecting, designing, technology), experimental and main production. They also manage the process of creating organizational, technological and qualification prerequisites for the development of creative activity, are concerned with the constant increase in the creative activity of staff.
The current system of remuneration and bonuses for managers is practically unrelated to the interests and objectives of a joint-stock company (firm, enterprise). In most state-owned joint-stock enterprises, official salaries are set in a certain ratio either to the tariff rate of a worker of the main profession of the 1st category, or to the average salary of employees. At the same time, the incentive fund used to reward managers is at their full disposal.
Currently, in most cases, the remuneration of the head is determined by the contract. It necessarily provides for all guaranteed and compensatory payments established by the Labor Code, as well as fixed in the collective agreement and the industry tariff agreement. But the contract should at least reflect two points: the amount of remuneration of the head and the results of the activities of the unit entrusted to him, which are very interesting to the owner. However, the second point in the contract, as a rule, is missing.
Meanwhile, in order for the contract not to be one-sided and take into account the results of the company's work, it is also necessary to specify:
- requirements for ensuring production activities (volume, structure and nomenclature of products);
- the most important quality indicators (labor productivity, profitability, profit, production costs, product competitiveness);
- parameters of production potential, progressiveness of equipment, technology, energy intensity of production, material intensity and resource intensity, etc.;
- indicators of human resources development (the need and provision of highly qualified specialists, the ratio of the actual and normative number of specialists and managers, etc.).
Shareholders are generally concerned that there is adequate incentive for the management team. At the same time, the subjects of special attention are:
- absolute level of remuneration;
- the ratio between the income of the administration and the annual income of shareholders;
- conclusion of alternative administration remuneration agreements;
- use of share options to reward managers â€” granting the right to purchase shares at a reduced price;
- establishing the dependence of remuneration on takeovers and acquisitions;
- the ratio of supply and demand in the market of administrative talents, etc.
Naturally, the first manager, on whom the well-being of the enterprise primarily depends, is financially rewarded much higher than other managers. He must be a person who is financially independent. In Russia, the remuneration of managers of all ranks differs significantly from the average. However, the "separation" of this category of workers from all others is much greater than it is provided for by all possible models.
At the same time, in developed countries, there is a special set of measures designed to protect managers in difficult situations associated with the risky nature of their activities, in order to preserve qualified management personnel, on which the success of the organization's innovation activity primarily depends.
Our current models retain a variety of different types of bonuses, surcharges and allowances that are loosely related to the employee's labor contribution, which complicates the mechanism of their organization and does not contribute to achieving a closer correspondence between the labor measure and the payment measure. All this makes it necessary to find new approaches to the organization of remuneration of employees of an innovation organization.
There is no doubt that incentives should be targeted at specific employees. Rewards for innovative ideas should be promoted more widely. The administrations of many organizations regularly, usually once a year, hold contests of ideas about the possibilities of creating a new business. Developments that are recognized as promising are implemented, and their implementation is entrusted to the initiator of the idea, who becomes the head of the newly appeared company. All the ideas put forward add additional points to his work biography.
In recent years, merit-based wage individualization has become widespread in many countries. Employees who have the same qualifications and occupy the same position, due to their natural abilities, experience, goals and motives, can achieve different results in their work, which should be reflected in wages. This is achieved by differentiating salaries within the category (or position).
The practice of using merit assessment indicates an increase in the number of employees to whom it applies. In the beginning, the assessment of merit was used in the organization of salaries of engineering staff workers, managers and employees, whose work results are difficult to express with the help of any accurate indicators. With the objective convergence of the content of the work of mental and physical workers, there is a convergence and methods of payment.
It is considered desirable that the manager should reward the employee for special merits and performance as soon as possible after the work is completed. The fact is that people with high adaptability quickly get used to the stereotypical incentive system. The person ceases to respond to the expected positive reinforcement, and that is why it largely, if not completely, loses its motivating potential. Moreover, if for any reason, even if it is quite justified, the expected encouragement is not received, then for the most part it is perceived as a manifestation of injustice and causes negative emotions in the "deprived". And, on the contrary, with unexpected encouragement, the employee is convinced that his extraordinary success is not only noticed, but also significantly rewarded. Rewards of this kind have a noticeable motivating effect even on people who are accustomed to achievements and rewards (and the method of material encouragement itself can have a greater motivating effect on the employee than its absolute value).
So, the success of innovation activity largely depends on understanding the fundamental principles of staff motivation. It is important that the manager does not just communicate his ideas about these principles, but also has a mechanism for their implementation in the daily activities of the innovation organization.
In the vast aggregate, we will highlight the following important principles:
- distribution of work taking into account professional and socio-psychological qualities of employees;
- priority of positive support. Positive support is more effective than negative reinforcement, and its method and form are more motivating than the immediate value;
- the urgency of the reward. Support should be immediate, which is expressed in an immediate and fair response to the actions of employees;
- incentive based on intermediate results. Employees should be rewarded for intermediate achievements, without waiting for the completion of all work. It is important to keep in mind that great successes are difficult to achieve, and therefore they relatively rare. Therefore, it is desirable to reinforce positive motivation at not too long intervals. But to do this, the overall task should be divided and planned in stages in such a way that each of them can be given an adequate assessment and proper remuneration, corresponding to the volume of work actually performed;
- unexpected rewards. Unexpected, unpredictable, and irregular rewards are more motivating than predicted when they practically become part of the salary.
The completed work and the unexpected payment for it should not be separated by too large a period of time, because the larger the time interval, the smaller the effect. immediate rewards can come in many forms (for example, T. Watson, the president of IBM, was in the habit of writing checks to employees during on-the-spot job rounds).
Special attention should be paid to the motivation of managers for creative activity, the development of innovative activities. To do this, it is necessary to analyze the motivational factors that affect the manager's attitude to the renewal of production, to know what motivational factors affect them.
The knowledge of these factors is the starting point for solving the problem of creating conditions that contribute to the implementation of strategic plans for the introduction of innovations (taking into account the activities of specific individuals and the real situation in the field of novations in an innovation organization).
All the motivational factors discussed above are mutually dependent. They are elements of a system in which managers make decisions that contribute to the development of the organization based on the dynamic introduction of innovative products and technologies. It is important to realistically assess the impact of factors, taking into account the specific conditions of their application.
The top management of an innovation organization should regularly analyze and respond appropriately to motivational factors and focus on long-term and short-term activities that support the real interest and activity of the organization's staff in implementing its innovation policy.
