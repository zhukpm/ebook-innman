All the functions of innovation management, which make up a single unbroken chain of activity of the head, are equally important, but still the most significant among them is the adoption of managerial decisions. This function seems to absorb the entire management process, completing it after appropriate adjustments, and its quality and effectiveness are the most important components of the success of a modern organization. In innovation management, decision-making is objectively associated with risk and high responsibility, requires a competent, creative approach and adequate information and legal support. At the same time, the specifics of the management object as an innovation one that needs significant investments, large-scale marketing and qualified scientific and technical personnel should be fully taken into account. Persons involved in decision-making must be able to analyze all options and choose the final one, have knowledge of the stages, procedures and all the subtleties of decision-making technology and other necessary qualities.
Each innovation solution is creative and unique in nature. More and more decisions are based on subconscious deep thinking processes and are intuitive. It is also important to note that innovation solutions largely depend on information support and constant monitoring of changing external environmental characteristics.
The process of making an innovation decision is preceded by the identification of the problem situation and its analysis. For each situation, several innovation solutions should be developed, from the totality of which the one that can provide the best results is selected.
An innovation organization must be constantly ready to make informed innovation solutions at all levels of the management hierarchy. In essence, the solution is designed to mobilize and focus all available resources to transfer the organization to a better state (in accordance with its goals and objectives). Everything that is done in an innovation organization appears as a consequence of the implementation of innovation solutions that form the content of the management process. It is innovation management solutions that allow us to achieve not only efficiency in production, but also to detect the creative activity of outstanding personalities.
The degree of validity of the innovative decision by the manager largely determines the results of the innovation activity of the entire team and its own well-being. the staff of the organization reacts negatively to unsuccessful decisions that reduce its prestige, worsen the material and social conditions of life axtivity. The decisions of the manager also affect the state of affairs in other organizations that are in cooperation with her.
Every decision is aimed at eliminating the existing conflicts and contradictions in the innovation organization of the economic, socio-psychological or organizational order. There is a need for this in any organization, but it is especially significant in an innovative type of organization that claims to create breakthrough technologies.
In the process of developing and making innovation decisions, the role of the manager is very clearly manifested. Through solutions, the focus of the organization's activity is determined, and its goals are transformed into concrete results.
When working on innovation solutions, various external and internal factors interact. The more complex the situation, the more clearly the "personal profile of the decision" is manifested, which is determined by the totality of the manager's qualityâ€”his psychological features education, experience, age, and internal goals. Equally important are the conditions for the functioning of the production and social environment, the properties of the problems being implemented, the level of technical equipment, and the availability of information sources.
Until recently, traditional organizational management structures were characterized by systems that are configured to make mostly individual decisions. In the changed environment, models focused on group solutions of an innovation orientation should dominate (to an increasing extent), in the development of which management teams consisting of intellectual labor workers take part. It is necessary to constantly improve the ways of involving the organization's personnel in the technologies of making intellectual decisions.
There is a great need to develop and adopt balanced innovation solutions based on a systematic approach that significantly reduces the risks of their implementation. The emerging risks cannot be eliminated without the active and interested participation of the organization's staff. We should not forget that the management process begins with decisions, and therefore their quality determines the success of management as a whole.
To develop effective innovation solutions, certain prerequisites are necessary, among which we will highlight:
- mandatory presence in every solution, regardless of its immediate purpose, social component;
- structuring of the problem;
- legal, resource and information support of solutions;
- development of alternative solutions and methods of their comparative evaluation;
- formation of systems of motivation and responsibility for the quality of solutions;
- availability of a mechanism for implementing and controlling the execution of solutions.
The quality of an innovation solution is directly dependent on how fully the basic universal requirements for its content are met:
- scientific validity of the solution which provided by compliance with the recommendations following from the philosophy and mission of the management;
- impeccable regulatory and legal reasonableness of the solution;
- the degree of quantitative uncertainty of the problem situation, the potential to increase the level of its certainty due to qualitative characteristics;
- priority consideration of external environmental factors that have the greatest impact on the quality of the solution;
- probability of execution of the solution according to the accepted criteria of its quality, costs and terms. 
With the increasing number and complexity of innovation solutions, the probability of contradictions between them (interdependent and interacting) increases. This reveals the fact that every decision is part of the system of decisions and therefore it must be consistent with them.
An indispensable general requirement for innovation management solutions is the development of a certain number of their variants. The analysis of a problem situation of any type is reduced, according to quite objective circumstances, to the consideration of a certain set of different options for its resolution, followed by a comparative assessment of them in order to choose the most acceptable one. Each option should be considered as a conjugate solution, as part of the whole.
Each innovation solution must have the necessary completeness, a clear indication of the goal, specific deadlines, the main ways and means of its implementation. It is necessary to know the essence of the problem situation under consideration, to identify the goal, to provide flexibility and legal protection of the solution, to provide motivation for employees in its adoption and execution. To transform an innovation solution into a real actuality, it must be timely, alternative, authentic, targeted, consistent, eligible and directive.
