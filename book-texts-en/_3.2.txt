Innovation is an activity based on the creation, development, dissemination and application of scientific and technical knowledge in all fields of science and technology. As a result, productive forces and organizational and economic relations in economic systems are transformed.
Innovation activity itself is an innovation process — the process of transforming scientific and technical knowledge into innovation, when in a sequential chain of events starting with a new idea, it matures, is embodied in a specific product, technology or service form, and then spreads through the practical use of the results. Consequently, new knowledge and experience in the innovation process are translated into innovative strategies, products and technologies. However, innovation processes can be considered not only as focused on the creation of a new product or technology (discoveries, inventions, and generally "know-how"), but also as an activity that results in the commercial sale of a new product (technique, products, materials), technologies, including new methods of organizing and managing production.
The innovation process does not end with the introduction (appearance on the market) of a new product and technology. As the spread (diffusion) of innovations, it continues to improve, to discover previously unknown consumer properties, is becoming more efficient.
It is important to properly understand the structure of the innovation process and to distinguish more clearly the successive stages of its dynamics. The quality of judgments about such a structure will depend on the tools used to regulate it, on what there are used:
- socio-economic and scientific-technical forecasts of state policy in the field of finance, prices, monetary circulation, reproduction and structural policy, etc.;
- state-administrative, general economic and market regulators;
- national and regional innovation systems that ensure the replenishment and effective use of scientific and technical potential, expanded reproduction of innovations, primarily for the sphere of material production, capable of self-development in changing conditions;
- mechanisms of state regulation of scientific, technical and innovative activities, including motivational, regulatory and other blocks;
- methods of complex resource, including investment, support of scientific, technical and innovative activities at all levels of the economy (from the organization to the macro level);
- forms and processes of constant updating of human and intellectual resources that can ensure the full functioning of all types of innovation activity and processes of innovation management, the organization of continuous reproduction of innovations.
The main types of innovation activity can be grouped as follows:
- preparation and organization of production — acquisition of equipment and tools required in procedures and methods for quality control (taking into account existing production standards), necessary for creating an innovative technological process;
- pre-production developments — modification of the implementing product and technologies that correspond to the training of personnel (existing or staff recruitment);
- production design — preparation of plans and technical documentation used in the development of technical specifications and production processes, purchase of equipment necessary for the implementation of product (process) innovations;
- acquisition of non-materialized technology (technologies-patents, licenses, "know-how", brands, trademarks and other services), the need for which arises with the advent of intelligent technologies;
- marketing of innovation processes (advertising campaign, market research, product adaptation to different markets and consumer groups, etc.).
Innovation activity, therefore, involves an extensive range of scientific, technological, organizational, financial and commercial activities, and as such is a continuation of scientific and technical activities in a single scientific and innovative cycle. In General, the types of innovation activities are innumerable, they are in principle present in every developing system and at all its levels, since this is the condition for its viability. The types of innovative activity include everything that concerns the creation and improvement of any component of an innovative organization.
In the field of innovation, there are national tasks that government agencies, business structures, and even public organizations are working to solve. They are engaged in creating and improving mechanisms for organizational, scientific, methodological and financial development and transfer of high technologies at all stages of the innovation cycle, which combines related innovative productions.
Plenipotentiary national administrations are called upon to achieve:
- the priority development of high-tech complex as a decisive factor in increasing the competitiveness of the national economy which significantly increasing the country's share in the world market of science-intensive products to upgrade the primary capital on a new, truly innovation technological base;
- the formation of scientific and technical complexes (centers) that include technological chains that allow reproducing mainly system products-innovations that can form (expand) their own niches in the world market of science-intensive products.
Studying the structure of innovation processes allows you to identify the main phases (stages) of the innovation process:
- Systematization of incoming ideas (collecting information about technological changes in the industry, potential opportunities of the company, market segments and trends in their development).
- Study and evaluation of the created subject of innovation: expertise, experimental (trial) verification, evaluation by experts (scientific and technical expertise).
- Selection of identified ideas and development of ideas for new product, analysis of economic efficiency, development of a marketing program, creation of a new product.
- Testing on the market of a new product, the final production justification for its implementation, taking into account the arguments about the positive effect of its creation.
- Introduction of the product into practice, formation of the material base for implementation, study of the subject of innovation and its practical development and subsequent practical application by personnel (a new product is introduced into production on the basis of a product marketing program).
- Study and evaluation of implementation results, further development of the subject of innovation.
