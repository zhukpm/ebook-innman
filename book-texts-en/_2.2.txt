To know the essence, features of innovation management and purposeful operate of its main categories, it is important to have the appropriate conceptual apparatus that characterizes this phenomenon.
The concept of "novation" (from "innovation") means the process of creating, distributing and using in economic and other systems novelties that have (in comparison with existing analogues) the ability to ensure more efficient operation of the organization, focused on meeting certain needs. Innovation is largely the result of scientific and technological progress and is applied in any spheres as an improvement that allows you to achieve cost savings or create appropriate prerequisites for this.
The concept of "innovation" is used in relation to new products and services, methods of their production, novelties (ideas and techniques) in the organization of management activities, and other useful improvements. The innovation process covers the cycle of operations from the origin of the idea to its practical implementation. Innovations are focused on meeting the demand of consumers and are implemented in a market economy mainly by entrepreneurial structures to solve production and commercial problems, ensure the stability of their functioning, economic growth and competitiveness.
For ease of understanding and use in practice, it is customary to classify innovations (as well as innovation activities) according to various characteristics or functions.
There are basis innovations (major inventions) that become the basis for the formation of new generations (directions) of technology; improving innovations that involve positive changes; rationalizing innovations aimed at partially improving outdated generations of equipment and technologies.
Innovations may differ by sphere of activity:
- product (technological) innovations aimed at creating new or upgrading already producing products;
- production innovations focused on expanding production capacity and diversifying production activities;
- trade innovations aimed at modification in trade activity, pricing policy, offering related services, improving the system and methods of marketing products.
From the position of the impact on consumers and producers of innovation (the consumer of new goods, services and their producer), an innovative product is considered as the implementation of a creative concept (discovery, invention), in which three components can be distinguished:
- need liable to be met (set of functions which to be performed);
- new idea (concept) about objects that is able to realize a specific need;
- the set of available knowledge, materials and available technologies that allow you to bring the conception to working condition. A product-novation is a product of scientific, technical and innovation activity that offers a new mean for the consumer or technology for the production of goods and services, opening up new spheres of implementation of needs. The impact of innovation on the producer of goods and services can be assessed through the degree of its novelty for the industrial enterprise; the nature of the concept on which the innovation is based; the intensity of innovation.
The most widely used classification of innovations covers the product, process, and strategy of innovation activity. In general, innovation means creating value in order to get capability for better meet the changing needs of customers, increase the number of consumers, and create new markets for the organization. In all these areas (strategy, process, product), there are many opportunities for innovation, and they are constantly changing and growing.
Strategic innovation involves revising existing in the industry methods of creating value for consumers in order to meet the newly emerged needs of clients increase the value of products, create new markets and new consumer groups, new approaches to marketing or advertising the products (services) offered, introduce new sales methods, and improve the customer service system.
The innovation of the process is not visible to the consumer and does not directly affect it. It reduces costs, increases labor productivity and the organization's profitability. Organizations use innovations to introduce modern production methods and technologies.
Innovation of a product-a commodity or raw material (extending to literally all types of products - from toothpaste to steel beams, from computers to glue, from a jet plane to a car and soybeans) is expressed in every operation that creates new value. These include paid services (merchant, medical, hotel, and other businesses).
All these innovations (strategy, process, and product) are divided into incremental, significant and breakthrough innovations, depending on how much they add value to the product or create new value for the consumer .
An incremental is considered innovation that have a small impact on the increase in the organization's net profit, but it is valuable because it increases customer satisfaction with the product. Another thing is a significant innovation that creates great opportunities to meet the needs of the consumer, helping the actual growth and development of the organization.
The scope of innovations action is so broad that it is not limited to new products and new technologies. The understanding of innovation is becoming more and more broad and is equated with strategy. A talented management-innovator can transform into a strategic innovation any type of product-process, especially one that addresses the immediate needs of the client. Innovative business-models are also included into the practice.
In principle, strategic innovation should be based on new technologies. However, this is not an absolute rule. For example, a strategic innovation of a number of airlines is based on the fact that passengers are offered low fares in exchange for refusing such amenities as pre-selection of seats on the plane, meals on Board, non-stop flights, the ability to book a ticket through an Agency, and other services that increase the cost of the ticket. For some companies, the strategic innovation is the system of retail sales through large warehouses.
The following types of innovations deserve special attention:
- social innovations related to improving working conditions, social protection, psychological climate, and internal inter-relations;
- innovations in the field of management that involve improving the organizational structure, style and methods of decision-making, and the use of new information processing tools;
- innovations in planning;
- motivational innovations;
- innovations in controlling;
- innovations in staff training;
- innovations in the evaluation and placement of management personnel.
Innovations should also be distinguished by the following attributes:
- technological parameters;
- newness;
- place in the organization;
- depth of changes which are made;
- sphere of activity;
- the most labor-intensive high-tech industries (such as the aerospace industry, the military-industrial complex, the production of computers and office equipment, pharmaceutical production, development and creation of electronic and production and communication equipment).
