The innovation goal is to focus the organization's activities on creating a certain novation, implemented in a given time frame with available (usually limited) resources, in order to significantly improve the quality of development of the innovation object (solving the corresponding problem situation). Innovation goals that involve the development of fundamental novations can be linked to patenting and licensing, the acquisition of know-how and industrial designs, and the life cycle of innovation.
These goals cover the entire management structure and are classified according to various criteria, the main of which can be recognized as the following:
- level of decision-making (strategic and tactical - branch and enterprise);
- type of environment in relation to the organization (internal and external);
- content (economic, scientific, technical, organizational, etc.);
- validity period (long -, medium -, and short-term);
- functions (production, scientific researches, design and experimental work, finance, marketing, personnel);
- stages of the organization's (project, program) life cycle — emergence, growth, maturity, decline, and completion of the life cycle. 
Each innovative organization has its own system of goals, which are determined to a decisive extent by the influence of the external environment and the internal needs of its development. From the point of view of internal needs, priority innovation goals are to strengthen competitive advantages, increase production efficiency and improve the system of services provided to consumers by increasing the scientific and technical, organizational, intellectual and economic potential of the organization. Its social goals are mainly to increase the wages (remuneration) of employees, improve working conditions and increase the social security of staff.
Priority, structural, and tactical goals of the organization are highlighted.
Priority goals are those that focus on the growth and development of the organization through the activation of innovation activity, as well as the promotion of new products and technologies to the market. Structural goals are to optimize the activities of the organization's related subsystems-production, scientific and technical services, finance, and personnel. Tactical goals are those that favor the intensification of the processes of development, development and implementation of novations, training of relevant personnel, and stimulating their activities, taking into account the specifics of motivation.
In large organizations, the structuring of innovation activity is accompanied by the construction of a "goal tree".
An essential methodological aspect that is important for understanding innovation management is the awareness of the significance and role of external and internal factors that affect the process of its formation, as well as the functioning of the innovation business environment.
Many external environmental factors, in turn, can be combined into two groups:
- directly affecting the work of the organization-laws and institutions of state regulation; suppliers of materials, equipment, energy, components; consumers of products; competitors (manufacturers of similar products); trade, financial and other intermediaries;
- indirectly influencing the organization's work — the state of the economy, scientific and technological progress, political, environmental, cultural factors, etc.
External factors cause changes in the organization, which are expressed in its reorganization (engineering), quick response to external influences, and adjustment of organizational structures.
Internal factors that directly affect the organization's innovation activity include:
- science-intensity of production;
- scientific-research, experimental-design and experimental divisions;
- technical and technological level of production;
- the level of product quality;
- energy and capital intensity of production;
- the state of the ecology;
- the use of technology economy and saving;
- type of production (mass, large-scale, serial, individual);
- duration of production and circulation cycles;
- the level of diversification of production;
- equipment deterioration and capacity usage ratio;
- characteristics of the consumer market;
- staff skill level, a measure of their readiness for risks;
- culture and ethical values of the organization, etc.
The study of internal factors that directly affect the organization's innovation activity leads to the conclusion about the fundamental importance of the transition to dynamic and flexible adaptive organizational structures based on the principles of innovation activity.
