Types and models of innovation solutions are diverse, complex and dynamic. In practice, it is necessary to make decisions mainly in conditions of uncertainty and risk. They are often intuitive, heuristic, approximate, hypothetical. Innovative solutions can also be individual, local, repetitive, predictive, forward-looking, global.
You can imagine a simplified scheme (fig. 7) of work on an innovation solution, consisting of three blocks (preparation of the solution, its adoption and implementation). It reflects the basic and consistent components of the decision-making process.
First of all, you need to have a clear understanding of the task on which an innovation solution is being made. The presence of a formulated problem means that from this point on, the organization has forecasting assumptions about possible ways to solve it innovatively.
It is also necessary to define criteria for selection of innovations to be compared and selecting the best (e.g., costs of innovation, innovation lifecycle, the impact of its use). According to the criterion, the options are arranged in the order of their preference. On the basis of this criterion, various indicators can be used, which are its certain measure and allow determining the effectiveness of a particular solution.

The development of a certain number of solution varies allows different approaches to the problem situation. In other words, the options reflect possible innovations, as well as ways of their implementation, from which you should choose the best option from the position of the accepted criterion, taking into account the specifics of the organization, the goals set and the situation in the external environment.
It is necessary to clearly formulate and describe the problem situation in order to develop an optimal solution. To make the description reliable, you should first ask the following questions: "what?", "where?", "when?", "why?", "for what purpose?" and "under what conditions?" After receiving the required information, you can get an idea of the essence of the problem situation, the main factors and conditions of its development, the relevance and urgency of its solution.
The content of the analysis of the problem situation can be reduced to the following points: 
- identifying the causes of the situation emerging;
- determination of the degree of its novelty, interrelation with other problems;
- establishing a measure of the solvability of the problem, primarily from the point of view of information and resource support.
Various methods are used to analyze the situation and select options. The most widely used methods of mathematical statistics, game theory, probability theory, linear and nonlinear programming, simulation models, graph theory, queues, queuing. It is important to ensure a proper balance in the use of modern analytical methods and subjective judgments in the practice of making innovative decisions.
The system analysis of an innovation problem situation includes as one of its stages a comparison of various options for action in terms of cost and efficiency in achieving a certain goal. Usually, an option is selected that provides a minimum cost for achieving some of the specified results. The development of such estimates is called the "cost - effectiveness" analysis (or, respectively, the "cost - utility", "price - quality" analysis).
However, there are problematic situations that cannot be quantified. they are characteristic of the innovation economy. Therefore, their assessment is largely based on the subjective judgments of managers. But this does not mean that decisions are "taken from the ceiling", because we are talking about managers who are well acquainted with the problems of the innovation economy and are able to reduce possible risks to a minimum.
It is recommended to conduct an analysis of management situations in the following directions:
- is there a real need for innovations in the organization, and if so, in which departments?
- to what extent can the costs of implementing the selected alternative innovations be justified and what is the possible degree of their implementing?
- do alternative innovations sufficiently reflect the mission of the organization and the specific features of its industry affiliation?
- do the projects of innovation solutions come into conflict with the existing atmosphere, style, culture and ethics of management in the organization?
In innovation management, the types and models of decisions made depend on the stages of the innovation life cycle (activation, maturity, growth, deceleration, saturation, decline). So, at the stage of finding the idea of innovation, decision-making is purely creative. The stage of materialization of an idea is probabilistic, but decision-making at this stage already consists mainly of procedures for goal-oriented rational action. At the later stages of the innovation life cycle (implementation, production and commercialization), general management methods are mainly used.
Innovations can be introduced in an innovative organization at any stage of the product life cycle, but it is another matter that the estimates of the results for them will differ significantly. At the stage of activation and maturity, the largest part of innovations is accounted for. The resulting opportunities for expanding production are attractive to investors, as they guarantee a quick return on investment. A further inevitable slowdown in growth leads to a downturn. Naturally, when making decisions regarding the choice of investment directions, the manager proceeds from the features of the existing stage of the life cycle of an innovation product.
