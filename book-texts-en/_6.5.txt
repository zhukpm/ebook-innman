The innovation target program is a set of planned scientific and technical, production, economic and organizational-management activities, united by a single purposeful process system "research-production-management", covering functionally, as well as by resources, terms and performers all its interrelated stages.
With the development of the national innovation system, the trend of organizations ' interest in targeted programs increases (as the scope of their application expands). Federal and regional programs, as well as in-house innovation programs, balance sheets, and models for optimizing economic processes are becoming increasingly popular.
Система программно-целевого управления создает предпосылки для:
- the most rational interaction of all departments engaged in the implementation of innovations in production and economic activities;
- improving the efficiency of managing the development of the organization by bringing management bodies closer to the performers;
- ensuring effective control over the performance of work, creating a basis for administrative regulation and motivating higher results of work in terms of quality and timing;
- increase the responsibility of the organization's management bodies and performers engaged in the development and implementation of innovations (for the results and deadlines of work);
- releasing top managers from the functions of operational management and coordination of actions of performers engaged in the creation and implementation of innovations.
The noted advantages of innovative programs implemented at the level of an innovation organization are particularly effective in the processes of reconstruction, expansion of production units, and introduction of technological innovation complexes in the development of new products.
In a modern economy with a high level of production and management cooperation, the development and development of innovations cause many horizontal links that extend to all levels of the management structure of an innovation organization.
Requirements regarding the quality and timing of work on the creation and development of product, technological, economic and other innovations, as well as the need for broad inter-functional interaction, are being tightened, forcing us to review and expand the criteria for their effectiveness.
These requirements are met with the transition of an innovative organization to targeted programs. According to the scale and level of interaction, targeted innovation programs can be divided into two groups:
- innovation programs implemented during the entire project period with the participation of a group of departments based on their use of centralized resources of the organization;
- inter-functional programs that temporarily involve one or two interacting departments that are focused on solving a specific target task with resources allocated to each of them.
For the organization of a flat management structure, horizontal links are established for a long period, and their regulation does not need additional intervention from higher-level organizations. However, when new, non-standard problems arise, a significant part of which requires creative solutions to be made jointly by specialists from different services and departments, the stability of the functioning of production organizations is disrupted. Such problems include the transition to the creation of fundamentally new products or a radical change in technology, the use of original ways to solve particularly complex design, technological, and economic problems. When they occur, it is necessary to redistribute existing or form new horizontal links.
The approach to the object of management as a single integral system with an emphasis on identifying the relationships and interdependencies operating in it is the basis for creating such organizational forms and management structures in which the entire set of functions, works and efforts is subordinated to the achievement of the final goal of the system. This is what determines the essence and purpose of program-target management methods.
Targeted programs require unified management, centralized strategic planning, financing, monitoring, coordination, and legal support.
The highest line manager of an innovation project, who is authorized to make management decisions, is the technical director or chief technologist of the organization (if there is a lot of work to be done on the preparation of technological documentation). In all other cases where additional resources are required, as well as for the reconstruction of production facilities, correction of relationships with suppliers and consumers, the management of an innovative project is entrusted to the highest line manager. The scientific and technical council, which is authorized to review and make recommendations on the implementation of programs, should function as part of the top management.
The program managers who have the authority to make decisions on their implementation and, in particular, on planning, organization and coordination, as well as on accounting, monitoring and motivating the activities of subordinates reports to top-manager. Program managers are in charge of performers, specialists of the target team, engaged in the development of technical documentation and performance of production operations.
Program managers are required to:
- ensure the implementation of decisions considered by the scientific and technical council under the top management;
- authorize decisions concerning techniques and organization made in the course of interaction with co-executors and other divisions of the organization;
- promptly coordinate work;
- evaluate the implementation of the plan by departments and accept work.
Innovation activity by its nature is such that it involves the involvement of many specialists of various profiles and various departments of the organization. The organizational form of coordination of their activities is meetings that involve the preliminary preparation of documents considered at them.
