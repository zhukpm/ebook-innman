Rules for "brainstorming". The creative imagination of the participants is not restricted in any way and they can express any ideas; criticism and form of evaluation of the ideas expressed is not allowed. Everyone may supplement and develop considerations of any participant of meeting, but has no right to challenge them; the evaluation of scientific and practical importance of ideas is carried out after processing of materials of meeting. All ideas put forward are explored, even if their feasibility is questionable at the moment; points on which agreement is reached are recorded in the minutes of the meeting, signed by the chairperson and each participant; recommendations that for one reason or another cannot be implemented are structured for further refinement or presentation to a special meeting for discussion.
