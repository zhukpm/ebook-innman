The Japanese control system. is based on a group-oriented model of human relations. An individual employee should subordinate his or her interests to the interests of the group that requires loyalty from its members and rewards them for this loyalty. Consent within the group is on the first place. Much effort and time is spent to achieve intra-group consensus. This management model does not allow competition within a group; it exists between groups. It is the group, not an individual employee, who is rewarded for success. There is a principle: one for all and all for one.
