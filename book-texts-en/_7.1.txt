Innovation activity is unthinkable without proper and continuous resource provision, support and development of innovations. Adequate investment and investment of capital in innovation is a very important part of innovation activity. Other forms of investment in this activity (lease, acquisition of fixed assets, land, intangible assets, working capital, etc.) are carried out in case of economic feasibility.
Investment activity, as is known, includes marketing research of the investment market; investment of funds for the purpose of preserving and increasing capital; design, construction or acquisition of a ready-made investment object. The financing of innovation activity should be based on a quick and effective financial return on such activities.
The system of financing innovation activity is a complex interweaving of forms and sources that differ in the type of ownership, degree of centralization, and forms of financing.
The following classification of sources of innovation financing can be proposed.
By type of ownership, sources of financing are divided into:
- state investment resources (budget funds, funds of extra-budgetary funds, state borrowings, blocks of shares, state property);
- investment (including financial) resources of business entities of commercial and non-commercial orientation, as well as public organizations, individuals, etc.;
- investment resources of collective investors, as well as investment funds and companies, non-state pension funds, and insurance companies.
This also includes own funds of enterprises, credit resources of commercial banks, other credit organizations and investment banking structures specially authorized by the government.
At the level of the state and constituent entities of the Federation, the sources of funding are:
- resources of budgets and extra-budgetary funds;
- attracted funds of the state credit-banking and insurance systems;
- borrowed funds in the form of external international borrowings and domestic debt in the form of government and other loans.
The state should create favorable conditions for attracting investment in the real sector of the economy, legislatively support and finance innovative projects focused on the development of mainly science-intensive areas of activity.
For the purpose of economic stimulation of innovation activity and implementation of innovations it is necessary to:
а) improve methods of direct financing-strengthening state support for fundamental and major applied research and development, creating innovative funds, expanding banking services, leasing, project financing;
b) increase the efficiency of the use of methods of indirect funding (tax, credit, depreciation benefits).
As specific forms of state support for innovation activities, the following are used:
- direct financing;
- providing free bank loans to individual inventors and small innovation enterprises;
- creation of innovation venture funds that enjoy significant tax benefits;
- reduction of state patent fees for individual inventors;
- deferred payment of patent fees for resource-saving inventions;
- accelerated depreciation of equipment;
- the creation of a network of technology polises, technology parks, etc.
The concept of a financial mechanism for implementing state innovation policy is characterized, first, by a targeted focus on combining direct state budget financing of innovation programs and projects with financial support from individual scientific organizations, and second, by a multiplicity of funding sources, when extra-budgetary sources, including funds from commercial banks, associations, and organizations of other economic entities, participate along with budget allocations. The state order as one of the main instruments of the state innovation policy is of particular importance in this mechanism.
At the organization level, traditional sources of financing are:
- own funds (profit, depreciation deductions, insurance indemnities, immobilized surpluses of fixed and working capital, etc.);
- raised funds received from the sale of shares, as well as contributions, target receipts, etc.;
- borrowed funds in the form of budget, Bank and commercial loans on various bases.
The organization's funds should be allocated to the stages of the innovation life cycle. Innovation processes are financed from our own sources — from mastering the achievements of scientific and technological progress in production to successful commercially efficient consumption and after-sales service. So the initial phase (scoping of investment opportunities) includes a preliminary study of the demand for products and services, assessment of baseline, current and forecasted prices for the products (services), preparation of proposals on the legal form of implementation of the project, initial permit documentation and the list of participants, estimates of the expected volume of investments in the integrated standards and a preliminary assessment of their commercial effectiveness, and arguments to the preliminary estimates by section of the feasibility study of the project, approval of the results of the justification of investment opportunities, preparation of contract documentation for design and survey work, as well as an investment proposal for a potential investor (or a decision on financing work on the preparation of a feasibility study of the project).
Based on the analysis, possible directions for strengthening financial support for small businesses, which play an important role in innovation, are determined. The system of organization of financial regulation should include the following main blocks: state financing, attraction of capital of banking structures, attraction of own funds of small businesses, attraction of financial and material resources of large enterprises. To create such a system, it is necessary to adopt a package of special laws and regulations.
Under the current conditions, it is considered preferable to provide state funding for the organization through a network of regional funds, as well as to Finance specific targeted and regional programs within the framework of the country's socio-economic development programs. It is also necessary to create a network of specialized commercial banks to serve small businesses and create a Federal guarantee fund. To increase the activity of commercial banks to invest in small businesses, it is desirable to encourage them through preferential taxation.
Attracting capital from large enterprises is considered appropriate to organize through subcontracting and leasing systems of business activities.
The government can provide more support to small businesses through loans and subsidies provided in the form of preferential investment loans (for the development of high-tech industries, loans for creating their own enterprises in the implementation of targeted programs, regional loans). This requires the creation of private specialized banks, where funds can be sent from a special budget fund. Subsequently, the banks themselves will also be able to provide long-term loans to small businesses at various preferential rates.
