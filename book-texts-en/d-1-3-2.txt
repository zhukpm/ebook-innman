Mixed economy. is a qualitative condition of economic system, allowing multi-subject, multiplicity of ways and methods of regulation of economic and social relations, and also set of forms of ownership and management.
Mixedness of economy is shown and realized in the market mechanism of self-regulation and is supplemented with conscious influence of state institutes on those economic and social processes where the market gives "misfires", and effective reaction of civil society institutes to "misfires" not only of the market, but also of state authorities and management bodies correcting them. Mixed economy primarily relies on the price system for its organization, but at the same time uses the diversity of government intervention to cope with macro-economic instability and market failures.
