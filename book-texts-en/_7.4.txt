One of the properties of venture capital is its growing connection with intellectual labor, new knowledge, and intellectual industrial property. Intellectual property, which is embodied in various innovations and is the result of creative activity, needs state protection and approval of the exclusive rights to it of individuals or legal entities.
The composition of intellectual property objects is determined by the Convention on the establishment of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), adopted at the diplomatic conference in Stockholm in 1967 y. WIPO serves as the secretariat of almost all unions and organizations for the protection of intellectual property. According to the Convention, intellectual property includes (as applied to the sphere of innovative economy) the right to:
- inventions in all areas of human activity;
- hypotheses (conceptions);
- scientific discoveries;
- scientific and design developments;
- industrial samples;
- trademarks, service marks, firm names and commercial designations;
- protection from unfair competition and rights related to intellectual activity, including in the production field.
Intellectual property implies the exclusive right of an individual or legal entity to the results of intellectual activity and equivalent means of individualization of the legal entity, individualization of products, works or services performed (brand name, brand, etc.). In most cases, intellectual property items as the results of creative work are named after their authors.
The rights to an invention are registered by obtaining an author's certificate or patent. The author's certificate certifies the invention itself, its priority and the authorship of the person for the invention received by him. This invention cannot be freely and gratuitously used in other countries (if it is not patented there).
A patent is a document certifying authorship and granting its owner the exclusive right to an invention (no one can use an invention without the consent of the patent owner). In essence, a patent is the title of the owner of an invention, supported by an industrial design or trademark registration. Consent to the use of an invention is expressed by issuing (selling) a license for partial use or full transfer of patent rights.
Issues of patent protection are regulated by the Russian patent office (Rospatent), which, in accordance with the Patent law of the Russian Federation, implements a unified policy in the field of protection of industrial property objects, admits to examination inventions, utility models and industrial designs, conducts state registration, issues patents, issues patent rules, etc.
