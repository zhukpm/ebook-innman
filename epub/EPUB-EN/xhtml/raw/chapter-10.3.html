                    <p>
                        Let's first consider some of the most common methods of developing <span class="font-it">group solutions</span> that are most important for the development of an innovation organization.

                            This method is focused on the mobilization of knowledge, experience and creative abilities of employees to solve a particular innovation problem, the search for non-standard ways and technologies. The subject of the "brainstorming" and its main problems are communicated to the participants of the discussion in advance. The purpose of the discussion is to identify the main factors that determine the further development of the problem under consideration in order to develop and adopt an adequate solution to it.

                    <p>The composition of the meeting participants is formed in such a way that each of them can contribute to the solution of the problem. To do this, it is advisable to invite representatives of various departments and specialties, not only related to the solution of this problem, but also not directly involved in it.

                    </p>
                    <p>Successful "brainstorming" sessions are based on the following rules:
                        - the creative imagination of the meeting participants is not limited in any way, and they can express any ideas. The more ideas and the more unusual they are, the better, because it increases the likelihood of valuable ideas appearing (it is assumed that among the many ideas there will necessarily be some good ones);
                        - criticism and any form of evaluation of the ideas expressed are not allowed, only constructive suggestions can be put forward. Everyone can supplement and develop the views of any participant in the meeting, but does not have the right to criticize or challenge them;
                        - evaluation of the scientific and practical significance of ideas is carried out after the end of processing the meeting materials. At the same time, all the ideas put forward are examined, even if their expediency at the moment is doubtful;
                        - all points on which agreement is reached are recorded in the minutes of the meeting, which is signed by the chairman and all participants;
                        - recommendations of the participants of the meeting, which for one reason or another cannot be implemented, are structured for further elaboration or submission to the special meeting for discussion.

                            In the "brainstorming" method, the problem that is put up for discussion is first formulated in generally accepted terms that exclude its ambiguous interpretation, and in a form that allows its division into a hierarchical system of sub-questions. The more specific and precise it is formulated, the more meaningful will be the recommendations on how to solve it. At the same time, the quantitative and qualitative characteristics necessary for a complete description of each sub-question are determined, as well as the conditions for their solution, in the form of an indication of possible research methods, a list of resources, the scale of measurements and estimates. Information on the issue to be discussed may be provided to the participants of the meeting either one or two days in advance, or immediately before the start of the meeting.

                        To summarize the meeting, a small group of specialists on the problem under consideration is created. The Group examines and evaluates the proposals made by the participants of the meeting. At the same time, you will find proposals that can be implemented quickly and do not require special time and financial costs, then subject to further study and, finally, those that do not find direct application or seem unacceptable. Further, these proposals are considered by specialists in order to identify acceptable ways to solve the problem.

                    <h4>Expert method</h4>
                    <p>
                        Quite often, to get out of a problem situation, there is a lack of available potential of managers and the advice of specialists is needed. Therefore, it is desirable to choose experts from among those who combine knowledge of the specifics of the object under investigation with knowledge in the field of management science. As such, employees of research and design organizations of the relevant industry, teachers and researchers of educational institutions that train specialists for this field of activity, employees of similar or higher-level organizations can act. Experts are called upon to evaluate innovation ideas and projects, to solve all the tasks that are unusual for the organization, generated by a competitive market. Expert methods allow us to solve problems with incomplete and contradictory information, in conditions of uncertainty, when the situation is practically not amenable to algorithmization.

                            Experts from consulting companies help navigate the complex world of corporate tax and financial schemes. The participation of consultants is desirable at all stages of the organization's activities-from registration and establishment of its work to liquidation, which should also be carried out professionally. The consultant will promptly warn the customer about the dangers that are more than enough in the market element. But whatever the status of the consultant, the head of the organization is responsible for strategic planning.

                        Management consulting, as a rule, is a specialized. Some consultants solve general problems — develop an organization's strategy, reconfigure its organizational structures, improve decision-making technologies, etc., while others focus on solving specific problems (personnel training, creating a document management system, establishing constant control over performance activity, etc.).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Experts in their activities use a variety of methods and techniques that are adapted to the type and conditions of decision-making. They consistently mark critical points in time at which changes in the trends of the situation, jumps in the values of factors, etc. can occur. After the establishment of critical points, the expected values of factors at these points and trends in the desired values are determined. Thus, alternative scenarios for the development of an innovative problem situation are developed.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The correct choice of questions to be answered by experts is of great importance for ensuring the reliability of the examination. It is advisable that these issues be discussed in advance with the administration of the surveyed organization, and then finally edited with the participation of experts. At the same time, it is necessary to identify groups of questions for experts concerning the objectives of the object that has been surveyed; factors that hinder and favor their achievement.


                    </p>
                    <h4>Script method</h4>
                    <p>
                        A scenario is a detailed description (mostly qualitative) of successive events that bring the problem situation closer to the desired end state with a certain probability. The situation should be investigated systematically, in a logical sequence, answering intelligibly the questions: "what?", "where?", "when?" and "why?", "for what purpose?", "under what conditions?"

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main components of the description of the problem situation are:
                        - the essence of the problem and its relationships to other problems;
                        - sources of occurrence and trends in the development of the problem situation;
                        - relevance and urgency of solving the problem;
                        - degree of completeness and reliability of information.

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>сущность проблемы и ее взаимосвязи с другими проблемами;</span></li>
                        <li><span>источники возникновения и тенденции развития проблемной ситуации;</span></li>
                        <li>
                            <span>актуальность и срочность решения задачи; ® степень полноты и достоверности информации.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="nota-bene-1">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col text-block">
                        <p>
                            The most important advantage of the script method is the possibility of integrating (in contrast to abstract and formal methods) a set of factors sufficient for a reliable assessment of the problem situation (starting with the analysis of the likely long-term competitive advantages, comparative potentials and prospects of their rivals and ending with the social consequences of the predicted results). On this basis, it is possible to form a set of reasonable options for innovative situations and determine the degree of solvability of the problem.

                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The script method allows you to show high flexibility and, if necessary, easily adapt to conditions of uncertainty and risk. this method combines the advantages of completeness, structuring and objectivity of the factors influencing the situation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there is a need for in-depth study of any aspects that are most relevant to the situation, relatively independent sub-scripts can be developed within the general script (which is practically impossible when using an abstract model). This makes it easier to convert them later into an improved version of the initial scenario. At the same time, it is important to have a well-developed coordination methodology (for example, by iterating the desired sub-scripts).


                    </p>
                    <h4>Risk-solutions</h4>
                    <p>
                        As part of the individual innovative management solutions, we will highlight risk-solutions and solutions based on intuition.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the situation of choosing an alternative solution, the great concern of the head of an innovative organization is to overcome uncertainty and prevent risks. For this purpose, the level of probability of achieving the desired result, failures and deviations from the projected goals is estimated by means of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risks that are practically inherent in each of the considered alternatives. Opportunities for this are created through proper information support of solutions, including the use of mathematical methods. At the same time, it is possible to reduce the level of uncertainty of the situation and risks, but the main thing is still to rely on the professionalism of the manager.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is impossible to predict and make a list of circumstances in which the manager can choose the best solution in a situation of uncertainty and risk. He must be aware of the limits of acceptable risk, be more attentive to making decisions with an unaccounted risk or with a risk that goes beyond the permissible deviations. Otherwise, the risk of an unforeseen and unpredictable increase in risks becomes inevitable, significantly complicating innovation processes.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experience and personality traits of a manager affect the risky solutions they make. The manager needs to determine the measure of risk. At the same time, what is important is what it mainly tends to — success or prevention of failure. When the desire for success prevails over the fear of failure, there is a "wise caution"- the average level of risk that insures against failure. If the manager mainly wants to avoid failure, then he makes a decision that eliminates the risk.

                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="nota-bene-1">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col text-block">
                        <p>

                            The leader of innovation orientation, whose desire for success prevails over the fear of failure, sometimes chooses an alternative solution that gives the best of all the expected worst results, despite the fact that in an unfavorable set of circumstances, he is able to incur significant losses. If the manager, first of all, wants to avoid failure, then being too cautious or even fearful, he chooses a solution with the smallest possible losses in the event of an unfavorable situation (according to the rule of minimizing the maximum loss, considered in game theory as the minimax theorem). Differences in the behavior of managers when solving risky tasks are largely explained by the divergence of their claims levels.

                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-12 col-lg-10 text-block">
                    <p>Not every manager shows a proper understanding of the risks. Often, an equal sign is placed between different risks. In many innovation organizations, risks are still considered a specialized and separate type of activity, the competence of organizational safety and labor protection services, which does not directly affect the results of the organization as a whole.

                    </p>
                    <p>Often managers try to adapt solutions to the level of their understanding of the problem, to build a simplified model of it, which makes it easier to implement it. sometimes, according to the model, the manager acts rationally, but in reality his behavior is far from the best and does not correspond to the real situation. It is also important to consider whether the decision is made alone, or whether the manager assigns it to a specially selected group of competent persons or an interested functional unit.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case when the manager makes a decision based on his subjective ideas, this does not mean that arbitrariness is allowed here (rather the opposite). A guarantee against possible arbitrariness is the technology of selecting managers, monitoring their activities, as well as attracting personnel with knowledge and experience sufficient to make informed decisions.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decision-maker must understand where the line that separates the calculated risk (justified and therefore acceptable) from the adventure runs.


                    </p>
                    <h4>Intuitive solutions</h4>
                    <p>
                        In an increasingly complex competitive innovation economy, growing risks and uncertainty are normal conditions for the functioning of organizations. However, traditional decision - making methods do not always satisfy managers. Intuition also plays a significant role here. The ability to make decisions based on intuition, for the most part, is possessed by managers who are able to foresee the future of the organization.

                            Intuition is beginning to take a very serious place in the theory of managerial decision-making. Currently, scientific research on the problems of intuition is becoming more focused and practical. Intuition turns out to be quite accessible to natural science research, since it is a psychological reality, the nature of which can be revealed. As we expand our knowledge of the laws of mental activity, initially complex and incomprehensible mental acts are transformed into regular ones that obey completely recognizable rules.
