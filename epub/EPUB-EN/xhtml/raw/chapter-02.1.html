                        In the life activity of most states, a period of transition to an innovative stage of
                        development is coming. An increasing number of factors are beginning to appear in the economic
                        system that indicate that states are entering a qualitatively new innovative environment of
                        social, industrial and economic relations. This is a very important moment in the development of
                        states, since they usually need not only to update the production base, but also to introduce
                        modern innovative technologies into the management system of various organizations.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The level of innovative development of the state increases the ability to effectively solve not
                        only internal problems, but also to achieve external goals. For their implementation, each
                        specific country must occupy an appropriate place in the world economic system, worthy of its
                        level of development.

                        In the era of large-scale changes, modern innovation policy is becoming a most important tool
                        for creating long-term competitive advantages, preserving national guidelines, and ensuring
                        sustainability and stability of development. It is no accident that innovation activity is
                        increasingly linked to the prospects for the development of states and improving the quality of
                        life of the world's population.

                        The modern stage of civilization development is characterized by rapid changes of the
                        geopolitical and economic space. New goals and objectives for the functioning of economic
                        structures are constantly being put forward, obliging staff to respond quickly to changes and
                        take appropriate for changes measures within the organization, make significant adjustments to
                        the management system. deglobalization processes are intensifying, competition is becoming more
                        intense and tougher, the product life cycle is shortening, the demand for research and
                        development and new forms of cooperation is growing. The need to make innovative decisions and
                        use effective forms of adaptation of organizations to the constantly changing real and virtual
                        life activity environment dominates.

                        Innovation problematics are becoming more and more relevant. It is innovations that lead to the
                        renewal of the market, the expansion of the product and service nomenclature, the creation of
                        new production and logistics methods, and the improvement of management efficiency and product
                        competitiveness.

                    <p>
                        In Russia, the innovative sphere of the economy is represented by a set of branches of the
                        national economy and spheres of life of the population. The source of its development is
                        innovations that are adequate to the quality of the changing system of regulated market
                        relations, used both directly in production and in management.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most important condition for the development of the innovation sphere is the national
                        innovation system. Building a national innovation system in a country begins with developing a
                        concept and making appropriate decisions at the political level, according to which intellectual
                        and financial resources are concentrated, and innovative organizations are rapidly developing.
                        The national innovation system involves the implementation of a process, starting from the
                        production of knowledge and ending with its implementation in innovative goods, services and
                        technologies.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main subjects of the innovation process are the primary links of the economic system — real
                        and virtual enterprises, organizations, whose development prospects are largely determined by
                        the effectiveness of innovations. The innovative activity of an enterprise or organization is
                        conditioned by the objective need for the development of science and technology, the laws of
                        market relations associated with the orientation of economic entities to demand and increasing
                        market needs, increased competition, and more complex economic relations.

                        The competitive advantages and competitiveness of knowledge-based organizations are provided by
                        intellectual resources, corporate, general and digital culture, innovative technologies, the
                        level of training of personnel, their ability to develop and implement competitive strategies.

                        Russia is at the stage of reforming and forming an innovation system, the quality of which is
                        adequate to the requirements of the market. Russian scientists and practitioners are making
                        great and increasing efforts to achieve this goal. There is achieved a common understanding of
                        the need to develop an innovation economy based on knowledge which embodied in intellectual work
                        and appropriate for it relations. The country is faced with the task of intellectualizing labor,
                        changing labor relations on this basis, accompanied by radical changes in the entire system of
                        organizations' life activity.

                    <p>
                        The processes of formation of an innovation economy indicate that the essence of the problem is
                        not so much in determining who develops innovation policy (which, of course, is important in
                        itself), but in who and on the basis of what inter-relations it is implemented.

                            on universal values, it is necessary to change the person himself and not only the
                            individual or the team, but the entire generation. We need highly spiritual people who
                            profess the philosophy of innovation management with a proper understanding, who have not
                            only sufficient competence, qualifications, communication skills and leadership qualities,
                            but also high culture in the broadest sense of the word.

                        leadership in creating breakthrough technologies that preserve the traditions and culture of a
                        multinational people and will take their rightful place in a globalizing world with its
