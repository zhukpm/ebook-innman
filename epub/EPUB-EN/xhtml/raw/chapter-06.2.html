                            Forecasting of an organization's innovative development is the stage of its activity that
                            precedes planning. At this stage, the search is conducted for probable directions of its
                            development in the long term, the object of the forecast is set and the forecast itself is
                            developed. In a more detailed form, innovative forecasting consists in evaluating and
                            selecting acceptable management decisions from several options for the organization's
                            development. These options should include indicators that will be used later in developing
                            strategic plans, determining the quality of products and services, and conducting research
                            and development.

                        Methods of expert estimations are based on generalized results of the polls. The survey subjects

                        technical and technological indicators.

                        Mathematical methods clearly and clearly define the parameters for performing operational

                            Planning is also a function of innovation management. It includes a set of activities that

                        innovative products (fig. 5).

                    <p>
                        The process of planning the release of such products, as well as the organization's innovation
                        activities in general, is complex and variable. It starts with the study of factors external and
                        internal environment of the organization, analysis of its research and development departments,
                        new product samples and technologies, with a study of the situation in the area of financial
                        activity. It analyzes the fundamental aspects of the organization's activity, the state of
                        production capabilities, innovative products, technologies, Finance and management, including
                        the management apparatus. This is followed by the process of developing plans directly.

                        It is very important to properly understand and apply the criteria for evaluating and selecting
                        innovation projects. For these purposes, mainly financial and economic criteria and
                        corresponding indicators are used. If necessary, when evaluating qualitative parameters,
                        characteristics are analyzed, which usually do not have a quantitative assessment, but
                        significantly complement the idea of the innovation organization's activity. In addition to
                        financial and economic criteria, there are regulatory criteria, criteria for providing
                        resources, and strategic criteria.

                    <p>
                        The following indicators are used: project cost; profitability calculated on the basis of

                        expenses, etc.
