                        Small innovative organizations play a very important role in the mastering of innovations, and
                        in many cases their performance is much higher than that of large organizations. This apparent
                        paradox is explained by the features and advantages of small organizations in the process of
                        performing scientific researches and experimental-design developments. Small businesses are
                        usually characterized by a cohesive and proactive staff with a developed entrepreneurial spirit,
                        always ready to take justified risks. At the same time, small organizations are characterized by
                        a quick response to internal problems and high adaptability to the changing economic environment
                        of a competitive market.

                            The operating conditions of a small business allow it to take responsibility for the
                            development and development of fundamentally new products and technologies with insufficient
                            prospects. Usually, large enterprises are wary of doing them, if only for the reason that
                            they may not justify large investments in the reconstruction of production.

                        Many innovative formations owe their appearance to small and medium-sized businesses. Statistics
                        provide clear evidence that, in general small organizations produce 2 times more novelties per
                        person than large ones.

                            High-tech small and medium-sized businesses focused on the development and production of
                            innovative science-intensive products are financially supported (to an increasing extent) by
                            venture capital-capital that is necessary and inaccessible in the initial period of
                            enterprise creation. Funds invested in new high-tech productions for the medium and long
                            term cannot be returned to investors, if for some reason they wish it, until the end of the
                            innovation life cycle. Venture financing is essentially a long-term loan issued to an
                            innovative organization on debt (without providing guarantees). The increased risk of the
                            investor is compensated by a higher percentage (in comparison with the one issued in banks)
                            and the probability of obtaining ultra-high profits in the future.

                        The mutual interest of the founders of a venture organization and its investors is to ensure the
                        effective and dynamic development of a high-risk innovative business that can become highly
                        profitable, and the opportunity in the future to become participants in the prestigious process
                        of innovation creators with far-reaching advantages.

                        Strengthening the position of small and medium-sized businesses, getting rid of any bureaucracy,
                        and ensuring sustainable and stable development require improving the framework conditions for
                        business activity. Simplifying the regulation of small and medium-sized enterprises will lead to
                        lower tax rates and administrative barriers.

                    <p>
                        Of particular importance is the provision of assistance to employees of small and medium-sized
                        businesses in improving their skills, as well as consulting. There is a significant need to
                        develop the institutional infrastructure of this business, including improving the personnel
                        services of regional authorities, forming centers for the establishment and supporting of small
                        and medium-sized businesses, etc.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Improving the financing of small and medium-sized businesses is still an urgent problem. It
                        requires the mobilization of significant refinancing funds, the opening of credit lines, and the
                        vigorous and fair use of financing programs, including those created by international financial
                        institutions. So far, there are no conditions for active development of innovative business in
                        the country. According to experts, the average utilization of even existing industrial
                        production capacities does not exceed 40-50 %.

                    </p>
                    <p>The innovation potential of small and medium-sized businesses is also not in demand. But it
                        creates the vast majority of the gross national product in all developed countries and is the
                        main source of increasing jobs and employment, including intellectual personnel. Small and
                        medium-sized businesses serve as the basis for the birth of the middle class, which is the
                        guarantor of the stability of society.
