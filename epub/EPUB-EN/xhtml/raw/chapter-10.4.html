                            The development and implementation of innovation solutions are directly dependent on the system of their information support. In this system, opportunities should be created for a detailed description of the innovation problem situation of interest to the organization (at an acceptable cost of time and money). The system must constantly provide its customers with the required information, grouped by composition, structure, frequency and other indicators.

                        All information that serves as a basis for making management decisions must be objective, reliable, complete, adequate, timely, accessible and relevant.

                    <p>
                        <span class="font-it">The objectivity of information</span> implies the ability to accurately display events or phenomena with its help. As it passes through the communication channels, the level of objectivity of information decreases. The position of things can be distorted to such an extent that it deprives decisions made on the basis of such information of more or less value.

                    </p>

                        For obtaining, processing and using information, it is conceptually important to have a predisposition to one data and distrust of other sources of information. At the same time, we are talking about human behavior in relation to information, when the assessment of an array of data that claims to be objective is significantly influenced by the management culture.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case, stereotypes are triggered — stable and simplified images or ideas about a particular positive or negative event, phenomenon, employee. They are formed in the process of repeated emotional and semantic emphasis of human consciousness on the corresponding objects. Almost every person who perceives information has certain stereotypes of thinking. the power of influence on human consciousness is so great that even false stereotypes, untenable conclusions and assessments can be perceived as true when repeated.

                            <span class="font-it">The reliability of information</span> is determined by how fairly it reflects the socio-economic and other parameters of the object under consideration. The degree of reliability is monitored throughout the entire process of using information, starting from the moment of its selection.

                        A common way to increase the reliability of information is filtering, when it is passed through so-called "filters" in order to give it more clarity and certainty (cutting off information that the user does not need). However, information tends to undergo distortions and lose credibility as you move through the levels of the management hierarchy. As long as the information is passed along the chain, its original meaning may be lost on the principle of a "broken phone" (decisions are distorted by intermediate managers).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason for the distortion of information can be an insufficient level of qualification of the information provider, considerations of prestige, emotional stress due to fear of punishment, anger, envy, increased attention to a certain range of phenomena, prejudice against the person about whom the information is given.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Understanding the reasons for misrepresentation of information makes it easier for the manager to critically perceive it, realizing the need to exercise special caution in relation to so-called confidential information, which in fact may turn out to be unfair.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reliability of information may suffer due to its redundancy. Experts believe that, as a rule, an excess of information prevents you from highlighting the main points of the situation and focusing on them, not to mention the fact that you have to spend more money on its collection, analysis and processing.

                    </p>

                        Many facts are known when a powerful flow of information received by e-mail, fax, internet and other communication channels negatively affects the effectiveness of the organization's activity, and causes irritation to employees. In practice, the average management company receives 178 messages a day, and about a hundred per night. They do not always manage to deal with this mail before the end of the working day and there is little time for making operational decisions. You should try to get rid of unnecessary information by collecting only the necessary address information (required, for example, by specific departments of the organization or customers), transmitting information as much as possible orally, visually and in other simple ways.

                            <span class="font-it">The completeness of information</span> is largely characterized by its quality and complexity, which are recognized as sufficient for making appropriate innovative decisions. Sometimes managers experience a lack of information due to the fact that not all incoming information is useful and can be used for management purposes. there are often situations when the general congestion of communication channels with information is not enough to prepare specific solutions. so, it is necessary to review the structure of information, to ensure its completeness.

                        <span class="font-it">The adequacy of information</span> expresses the degree to which it corresponds to the objective situation. It may be inadequate if the data is supplemented with incorrect data. However, even complete and reliable data can be transformed into inadequate information if inadequate processing methods are applied to them.

                        <span class="font-it">The timely information</span> means that it is received by the user in a time sufficient to develop a management decision (without the risk of obsolescence). The value of information is directly related to how quickly it reaches users. With the advent of new data, it loses its consumer properties and becomes of little use, if not completely useless.

                        <span class="font-it">The accessibility of information</span> involves obtaining it from statistical sources.

                    <p><span class="font-it">The relevance of information</span> expresses the degree to which it corresponds to the current moment. Often, the commercial value of information is associated with relevance, as well as with completeness. Since information processes are stretched over time, reliable and adequate, but outdated information can lead to erroneous decisions, become irrelevant and unnecessary.

                    <p><span class="font-it">The cost-effectiveness of information</span> should be ensured without compromising its quality. Obtaining any information involves certain costs and, as a rule, the higher its quality, the more expensive it is to collect, process and store it. It is desirable that with the minimum number of primary data and the least cost, the information contains the maximum useful information. It is necessary to find an acceptable ratio between the cost and value of the information used.
