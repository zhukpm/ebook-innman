                        There are various ways to achieve socio-economic goals. The most popular of them are those that
                        allow the organization to achieve impressive results in a short time (with a significant lead
                        over its competitors). Among such methods, there are known breakthrough technologies that arise
                        in the process of human development, as they acquire new knowledge that forms the basis of a new
                        qualitative round of improvement of civilization. Countries in which modern technologies are not
                        a decisive factor for development are increasingly lagging behind societies that create
                        breakthrough technologies and knowledge-intensive products in terms of population well-being.

                        Breakthrough are considered innovations (a product, service, or change in strategy) that lead to
                        a significant increase in the organization's revenue and net profit. The exact definition of the
                        term "innovation-breakthrough" is very difficult to give. It is necessary to consider and
                        disclose the essence of each specific innovation-breakthrough separately.

                    <p>
                        The results of implementing a breakthrough technology are always obvious and indisputable.
                        Breakthrough innovation involves the creation of new directions of activity (problem solving and
                        meeting needs, or even the formation of such). The creation of innovations of this type requires
                        appropriate personnel - innovators of high qualification, purposeful concentration of efforts,
                        the formation of a favorable intellectual environment. The main thing here is creative thinking,
                        free from stereotypes. In addition, highly effective innovation activity, coupled with
                        penetration into the field of breakthrough technologies, is impossible without intuitive
                        solutions.

                        Breakthrough technologies are also born out of new scientific paradigms, new knowledge that
                        extends not only to technical and technological, but also to social, organizational, and
                        economic areas. New knowledge allows you to create structures that serve breakthrough
                        technologies in the field of economics, politics, and business management. They provide an
                        opportunity to form and develop an organizational mechanism for combining efforts in this

                        All breakthrough technologies can be divided into two groups: forming and destroying the system.
                        The breakthrough technologies that form the system should correspond to the general cultural
                        values of civilization and not contradict them. Often they are born at the intersection of
                        cultures of peoples and their basis is the innovative achievements of these cultures. such
                        time-tested technologies serve as the basis for the development and survival of peoples.

                    <p>
                        In its turn, destructive technologies ignore cultural values, come into conflict with them and
                        are focused on extracting super-profits.

                            Breakthrough technologies can be critical and dual-use. Critical technologies are those that
                            are most important from the point of view of state needs and public interests. Critical
                            technologies can be identified in each of the priority areas of science and technology
                            development. They are cross-sectoral in nature and create significant prerequisites for the

                        There are several priority areas for the development of critical technologies at the federal

                        materials and chemical products, fuel and energy. Within these areas, the following critical
                        technologies were selected: atomic and hydrogen energy; catalysts; composites; laser
                        technologies; multiprocessor electronic computers with a parallel structure; non-traditional
                        technologies for processing solid fuels and uranium; polymers; mathematical modeling systems;
                        speech, text and image recognition and synthesis systems; technologies for deep processing of
                        mining and man-made raw materials using non-traditional methods; technologies for studying the
                        subsurface, forecasting, prospecting, exploration of mineral and uranium reserves; technologies
                        for monitoring the natural and man-made sphere; technologies for the regeneration of spent

                        Dual-use technology is technology for military and civil purposes. From the point of view of
                        resource efficiency, it is necessary to provide the best military technologies to the civilian
                        sector of the economy. This is the essence of dual-use technologies, which determines their
                        value. It is advisable for the military-technical complex to share its production capacity with
                        the civilian sector in order to produce the latest consumer goods and services on an industrial
                        scale.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dual-use technology emerged after the Second World War, when it was time to convert not only a
                        huge number of weapons, but also to turn military factories into factories that can meet the
                        rapidly growing demand of the population for consumer goods. Dual-use technologies have
                        introduced products such as computers, telecommunications equipment for offices, medical
                        instruments, calibration and measurement devices, including electronic-optical surveillance and
                        detection systems, as well as environmental monitoring technologies, and much more to the
                        civilian sector.

                    <p>
                        It is possible to distinguish the following main directions of scientific and technical activity
                        of the state on creation of breakthrough technologies of dual-use: laser, nuclear-thermonuclear,
                        plasmophysical, rocket and space, optoelectronic, microwave, information, communication,
                        non-traditional energy, construction, medical and preventive, training, diagnostic,
                        agro-industrial.

                    <p>
                        Аmong the breakthrough technologies, we can distinguish the category of so-called closing
                        technologies. Their appearance and use makes a huge number of existing technologies unnecessary
                        and outdated. For example, the advent of the computer made unnecessary the flourishing
                        industries in the past associated with the production of arithmetic meters, logarithmic rulers
                        and other similar products that were widely used in economic practice. closing energy-and
                        resource-saving breakthrough technologies can make revolutionary changes in the country's
                        economy.

                    </p>
                    <p>Modern breakthrough technologies are the product of collective creativity and, as a rule, require
                        high-class specialists for their implementation. therefore, the state is called upon to provide
                        society with highly qualified personnel, increasing investment in education sphere.
