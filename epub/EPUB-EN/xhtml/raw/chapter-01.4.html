                            The state sphere includes the legislative, executive and judicial branches of state power,

                            executive bodies of local self-government. In other words, the governmental sphere is

                        As for its functions, there are points of common, i.e. characteristic of the state as an
                        institution from the beginning of its emergence, particular — acquired in the conditions of each
                        individual socio-economic formation (slave-owning, feudalism, capitalism, socialism) and single
                        — conditioned by ethnic and religious specifics, features of the historical development of this
                        state.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Accordingly, the classification of socio-economic functions is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Common functions (characteristic of the state of all times and peoples).</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Particular functions (inherent in the state at this stage of development of society and the national economy).</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Single (specific) functions of the state that reflect the historical originality of its development, the mentality of society and the need to solve its vital problems.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The emergence of the state as a form of social existence was due to the need to ensure security.
                        As noted, the need for personal and property security calls to life the state, in which it finds
                        the main explanation of its existence, it also indicates to the state its main goal and purpose.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This logically implies the common, basic functions of the state, i.e. ensuring:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>a balance of economic interests of subjects of economic and socio-political life of society (for example, employers and employees, producers and consumers, urban and rural populations, the population of individual regions of the country, etc.);</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>the life activity conditions of society as a whole and the production and economic sphere in particular.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These are actually functions of self-preservation and reproduction of the state as such. Their
                        implementation guarantees the integrity of the state, the stability of the development of
                        society and the national economy. And if they are ignored by the government, then intra-system
                        conflicts become more acute, society inevitably degrades through the lumpenization of the larger
                        and oligarchization of its scanty part, the bonds of the integrity of the macroeconomic system
                        are destroyed, and thus the state itself is destroyed. This is evidenced by the recent history
                        of our time, when the country is under threat of collapse due to the divergence in the goals of
                        the state and civil society, the aggravation of not only economic and social, but also national
                        and religious conflicts.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These functions are basic and acquire their certain quantitative and qualitative certainty in
                        the conditions of each historical period. The national economy and society are living developing
                        organisms that require adequate actions on the part of the state and society.

                        The state in the era of the origin of the market economy and the first stages of its development
                        (in the context of the functioning of the national economy with a predominance of local markets,
                        low concentration and centralization of capital, underdevelopment, or rather primitiveness of
                        industrial and economic infrastructure and, above all, means of communication (transport and
                        communications), energy economy, weak development of civil society institutions) could largely
                        rely on market self-regulation of economic and social processes and perform the only regulatory
                        function (figuratively called the function of the night watchman), i.e. the guarantor of private
                        property and the rules of the game in the market space.

                        In the economic life of most industrial powers of the twentieth century (with the exception of
                        the Soviet system) over the past few centuries, there has been a gradual decrease in direct
                        state control over economic activity; feudal and pre-industrial conditions have gradually lost
                        their force and more and more importance has been attached to what has been arbitrarily called
                        "free private enterprise" or "competitive capitalism". Long before this trend led to the
                        conditions of full, i.e. after the absolute non-interference of the state in business life,
                        events began to take a different turn.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The economic crisis of 1873 heralded "the end of the era of liberalism — the end of a century
                        during which the political credo was the policy of non-interference in the economy. This era
                        began in 1776, with the publication of Adam Smith's "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of
                        the Wealth of Nations". In the ten years after 1873, the great liberal parties, which until then
                        had marched all over Europe under the banners of "progress" and "enlightenment", began a
                        disorderly retreat. And they never recovered from the defeat"<span class="footnote">7</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the end of the nineteenth century, almost all countries have been steadily expanding the
                        economic functions of the state. This was a reaction to the actions of civil society, which
                        forced the state to pay attention to the evils of monopolization of the economy, the spontaneity
                        of its development and the deepening differentiation of incomes of the population.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In expanding the economic functions of the state, J. Keynes saw "the only practical way to avoid
                        the complete destruction of existing economic forms and the condition for the successful
                        functioning of personal initiative"<span class="footnote">8</span>. Therefore, in modern
                        conditions, the basic functions of the state (ensuring a balance of interests and common
                        conditions for the life of society and the national economy) are specified in the following
                        specific functions that are immanent in a mixed (socially oriented) economy<span
                            class="footnote">9</span>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>ensuring a legal base and social environment that contributes to the effective functioning of the market economy;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>protection of competition;</span></li>
                        <li><span>promoting a socially equitable distribution of income;</span></li>
                        <li>
                            <span>adjusting the allocation of resources to change the structure of the national product;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>stabilization of the economy, i.e. control over the level of employment and inflation generated by fluctuations in the economic conjuncture;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>stimulation of economic growth.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These specific functions are inherent in all developed countries of the world community.
                        However, there are single moments in their implementation, due to the peculiarities of the
                        spiritual sphere that has historically developed for each of the countries. Due to these
                        circumstances, several models of a mixed (socially oriented) national economy have emerged.
                        These include, as a rule, the following socio-economic models:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>USA;</span></li>
                        <li><span>Japan;</span></li>
                        <li><span>the emerging common socio-economic model of the EU, and within its framework, the German, Swedish, French, British, and Italian models;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>of the so-called "dragon" countries of Southeast Asia (South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan);</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>of successful Muslim oil-producing countries (United Arab Emirates, Kuwait).</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For developing countries and primarily acquired the status of newly industrialized countries,
                        including countries "tigers" of Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the
                        Philippines) and some countries in Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile) and
                        countries in transition (transformable) economy of post-socialist territory and Russia, special
                        social and economic functions implemented by the developed countries of the world community, are
                        a guide of systemic change.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a guide, since the specifics of Russia and, above all, the specifics of the transition
                        state of the economy itself, which is very burdened by the collapse of the once unified national
                        economic complex of the USSR, the features of historical and national development require
                        adaptation of the mechanism for implementing these functions for Russian conditions. But it is
                        equally certain that the" design " of this mechanism must necessarily conceptually reflect the
                        fundamental aspects of its state and improvement in the countries of the mixed economy. Thus, it
                        becomes objectively necessary to adjust (formulate) the socio-economic functions of the state in
                        relation to the transition state of its society and economy.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the system of these functions, the functions of various nature are distinguished:

                        <li><span>system-reproducing.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The following socio-economic functions of the transition period state are system-forming:
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        The selected socio-economic functions of the state (in a transformed economy) are not strictly
                        separated in time, although, of course, at the initial stage of transformation, system-forming
                        functions prevail, i.e., those associated with the formation of a new quality of the system and
                        the destruction of the old one. But this does not mean that at some stage of the transition they
                        completely disappear. For example, the target function of denationalization and privatization
                        remains relevant and important throughout the entire period of transformation. Conversely, the
                        target function of structural transformation in its content is more related to system-affirming
                        functions, although the tasks to be solved within its framework should be laid down already in
                        the process of denationalization and privatization.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        System-affirming functions play an extremely important role in the transformation process. They
                        ensure that the process of transformation from one system to another is irreversible. These
                        include, first of all, the target functions of structural transformation. The past and continued
                        to benefit to this day, the structure of the Russian economy, its industries and economic
                        regions, industrial enterprises were the backbone and foundation of a centrally planned economic
                        system of the state that moreover had the status of a superpower. The reorientation to the
                        market model and the changed geopolitical position of the Russian state objectively suggest a
                        different structure of the national economy and its links. Only when creating such a system will
                        it be possible to state the irreversibility of transformation processes. Without solving this
                        problem, as well as stabilizing the level and quality of life of the majority of the population
                        (at least at the pre-reform level), the reversibility of the process is not only likely, but
                        also real.

                            Thus, if a system-forming functions of the state in the transformation period, primarily
                            associated with the formation of the necessary conditions of the functioning (moreover,
                            start) is a new economic system, a system-affirming are linked with-eating of sufficient
                            conditions for the irreversibility of transformation processes, the functioning of new
                            economic system on your own, inherent only to her material base.

                        As for the system-reproducing functions of the state during the transformation period, they are
                        related to the formation of conditions necessary and sufficient for the sustainable development
                        of the established system in a given country, as well as to the approval, strengthening and
                        expansion of its positions in the world economic and political space.
