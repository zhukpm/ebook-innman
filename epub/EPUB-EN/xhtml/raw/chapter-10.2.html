                        Types and models of innovation solutions are diverse, complex and dynamic. In practice, it is
                        necessary to make decisions mainly in conditions of uncertainty and risk. They are often
                        intuitive, heuristic, approximate, hypothetical. Innovative solutions can also be individual,
                        local, repetitive, predictive, forward-looking, global.

                            You can imagine a simplified scheme (fig. 7) of work on an innovation solution, consisting
                            of three blocks (preparation of the solution, its adoption and implementation). It reflects
                            the basic and consistent components of the decision-making process.

                        First of all, you need to have a clear understanding of the task on which an innovation solution
                        is being made. The presence of a formulated problem means that from this point on, the
                        organization has forecasting assumptions about possible ways to solve it innovatively.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also necessary to define criteria for selection of innovations to be compared and
                        selecting the best (e.g., costs of innovation, innovation lifecycle, the impact of its use).
                        According to the criterion, the options are arranged in the order of their preference. On the
                        basis of this criterion, various indicators can be used, which are its certain measure and allow
                        determining the effectiveness of a particular solution.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The development of a certain number of solution varies allows different approaches to the
                        problem situation. In other words, the options reflect possible innovations, as well as ways of
                        their implementation, from which you should choose the best option from the position of the
                        accepted criterion, taking into account the specifics of the organization, the goals set and the
                        situation in the external environment.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is necessary to clearly formulate and describe the problem situation in order to develop an
                        optimal solution. To make the description reliable, you should first ask the following
                        questions: "what?", "where?", "when?", "why?", "for what purpose?" and "under what conditions?"
                        After receiving the required information, you can get an idea of the essence of the problem
                        situation, the main factors and conditions of its development, the relevance and urgency of its
                        solution.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The content of the analysis of the problem situation can be reduced to the following points:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>identifying the causes of the situation emerging;</span></li>
                        <li><span>determination of the degree of its novelty, interrelation with other problems;</span></li>
                        <li><span>establishing a measure of the solvability of the problem, primarily from the point of view of
                        information and resource support.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Various methods are used to analyze the situation and select options. The most widely used
                        methods of mathematical statistics, game theory, probability theory, linear and nonlinear
                        programming, simulation models, graph theory, queues, queuing. It is important to ensure a
                        proper balance in the use of modern analytical methods and subjective judgments in the practice
                        of making innovative decisions.

                    </p>
                    <p>The system analysis of an innovation problem situation includes as one of its stages a comparison
                        of various options for action in terms of cost and efficiency in achieving a certain goal.
                        Usually, an option is selected that provides a minimum cost for achieving some of the specified
                        results. The development of such estimates is called the "cost - effectiveness" analysis (or,
                        respectively, the "cost - utility", "price - quality" analysis).

                            However, there are problematic situations that cannot be quantified. they are characteristic
                            of the innovation economy. Therefore, their assessment is largely based on the subjective
                            judgments of managers. But this does not mean that decisions are "taken from the ceiling",
                            because we are talking about managers who are well acquainted with the problems of the
                            innovation economy and are able to reduce possible risks to a minimum.

                        In innovation management, the types and models of decisions made depend on the stages of the
                        innovation life cycle (activation, maturity, growth, deceleration, saturation, decline). So, at
                        the stage of finding the idea of innovation, decision-making is purely creative. The stage of
                        materialization of an idea is probabilistic, but decision-making at this stage already consists
                        mainly of procedures for goal-oriented rational action. At the later stages of the innovation
                        life cycle (implementation, production and commercialization), general management methods are
                        mainly used.
                    </p>
                    <p>Innovations can be introduced in an innovative organization at any stage of the product life
                        cycle, but it is another matter that the estimates of the results for them will differ
                        significantly. At the stage of activation and maturity, the largest part of innovations is
                        accounted for. The resulting opportunities for expanding production are attractive to investors,
                        as they guarantee a quick return on investment. A further inevitable slowdown in growth leads to
                        a downturn. Naturally, when making decisions regarding the choice of investment directions, the
                        manager proceeds from the features of the existing stage of the life cycle of an innovation
                        product.
