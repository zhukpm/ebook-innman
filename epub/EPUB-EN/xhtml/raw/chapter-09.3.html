                        The creation of an innovation corporate culture largely depends on the manager, on his vision of the future and the idea of what methods should be used to instill in employees a sense of pride in their organization, how to develop creative principles and motivate specialists to achieve innovation goals. However, at the present time, no leader, even the most outstanding, is able to initiate all the bold initiatives that organizations need.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Culture develops through joint efforts, but at the origins of this process there is a leader. He forms the most significant goals for the strategic development of the organization, based on the corporate values recognized by the collective.

                            Because the culture of an organization permeates its entire structure, changing the culture is one of the most difficult tasks facing any senior executive. An organization faced with changes in the economic and social climate is obliged to change (sometimes radically) the methods of activity, and therefore its culture, which is characterized by relative stability. It is not always the leaders of organizations who realize this.

                        </p>

                        It is necessary to deeply analyze the culture of the organization and find arguments in favor of its fundamental changes, if such are really necessary. First of all, it is necessary to deepen their theoretical understanding of the innovation culture, to identify the factors that contribute to its development and inhibit it.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is useful for the head of the organization to have a concrete idea of the culture of his employees, to take into account the special conditions of their innovative activity. It is necessary to establish in advance what values they are most committed to, get acquainted with their personal data (characterological features, manner of expressing emotions, behavior, etc.). At the same time, the manager should have a fairly accurate idea of the ideal appearance of a specialist.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the formation of a corporate culture, it is very useful to eliminate all kinds of privileges for management (illegal from the position of the staff and causing its irritation). Developing innovation organizations have long understood this and are purposefully fighting this phenomenon. Nevertheless, in many foreign organizations, as in Russian ones, such attributes of power as a parking lot for senior management, a personal elevator, a buffet, a recreation room, etc. are still highly valued.

                    </p>
                    <p>Sociological and socio-psychological studies of different social groups confirm that innovation culture is perceived by them specifically as an objective reality that affects production and economic indicators.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model of psychological support for innovation cannot be developed otherwise than on the basis of the culture of organizations.

                    </p>

                        Let's consider the main components of the cultural and psychological environment, oriented to innovation activity. The prerequisites for the formation of such an environment are:
                        - flexible organizational structures;
                        - acceptable level of bureaucratization of management;
                        - state of organization's culture;
                        - focus on innovations;
                        - organizational forms of innovation management;
                        - experimental basis;
                        - consulting support.

                    <p>
                        Such an environment can be characterized using the following indicators:
                        - type of leadership and managing style;
                        - socio-psychological climate;
                        - delegation of authorities and adversariality;
                        - the satisfaction of material needs;
                        - past experience with innovations.

                        To successfully solve the tasks of forming a corporate culture, the head of the organization needs to ensure that the competence of senior managers is sufficient to ensure compliance with the culture and the chosen strategy.

                        Managers at all levels should:
                        - be open and interested in innovative ideas, support creativity, and facilitate adaptation to changing conditions.;
                        - use all available means to ensure that the organization's strategy meets the long-term interests of all those affected by it (consumers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, etc.);
                        - motivate initiators and agents of effective changes and cultural norms that promote future-oriented activities;
                        - be kept informed about the conformity of strategy and culture;
                        - regularly explain to the staff of the organization the meaning and benefits of the changes being implemented (not only their feasibility, but also the possibility of).

                            Human activity in the organization is encouraged by two groups of incentives: material (salary, bonuses, profit sharing, etc.) and non-material (job satisfaction, a sense of loyalty to the company, their colleagues, etc.). In practice, three methods of moral motivation of employees are widely used: recognition of merit, fair treatment, creating a sense of personal involvement in the success of the company, which strengthens the sense of loyalty and corporate pride in the organization's staff.

                        It is necessary to give team members the opportunity to independently choose the means of implementing innovations. In the absence of the right to choose, there is a danger of indifference, the innovative nature of the activity will not be perceived with due respect. Recall that in order to prevent the inevitable conflicts, it is important to maximize the potential of informal relations. In particular, you should not consider the rules as something static, developed once and for all. Progress in technology, rapidly changing new system of values and aspirations can make once-established rules inconsistent with reality.

                    </p>
                    <p>A talent formed corporate culture of an organization becomes a powerful strategic tool for multiplying and effectively using its innovation potential, mobilizing departments and individual employees to achieve common innovation goals.
