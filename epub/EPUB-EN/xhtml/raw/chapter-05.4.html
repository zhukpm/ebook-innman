                            The management of the technology park is a function of state and local authorities. The
                            government develops large-scale programs to support small and medium-sized businesses,
                            provides them with legislative assistance, and motivates the development of innovation
                            technologies in various ways.

                        Local authorities create conditions conducive to attracting innovator-specialists to work on
                        innovative projects in order to create of small innovative science-intensive firms in their
                        technology parks. The tasks they solve can relate to any aspect of management activity, it is
                        only important that they have an innovative focus.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technology parks usually create scientific centers that focus on turning knowledge into
                        inventions and technologies, and technology into a commercial product. The founders of
                        scientific centers can be entrepreneurs, financial institutions, industrial associations,
                        universities and other educational institutions, and, of course, regional and local authorities.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interest shown by local educational institutions in creating incubators and establishing
                        links with specific technology parks is quite understandable and natural. In the process of
                        innovation activity, progressive technologies are transferred from scientific centers to small
                        and medium-sized businesses. Specialists employed in scientific centers work under special
                        programs and publish their own projects in the press. It is important for them to find
                        entrepreneurs for their ideas. The responses of applicants who want to become entrepreneurs are
                        analyzed, after which they are interviewed and an incubation period is set for each applicant.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The search and selection of entrepreneurs for small and medium-sized businesses is a serious
                        problem for technology parks. Extraordinary innovative tasks should be assigned to
                        professionally gifted people who can take responsibility for achieving innovative goals. The
                        creative environment in the organization, its moral and psychological climate, which is
                        favorable for combining the employee's personal interests with the collective ones, is of great
                        importance for the implementation of the staff's innovation potential.

                        It is recommended to differentiate the approach to innovators based on the role functions of
                        participants in the innovation process.

                    </p>
                    <p>Managers differ:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>initiating new ideas at all stages, starting from the R & D stage and up to the creation and
                        implementation of innovations;</span></li>
                        <li><span>providing communication links, accumulating the scientific, technical and market information
                        required for the organization's functioning (through the incorporation of knowledge and its
                        dissemination in the organization);</span></li>
                        <li><span>creating conditions for the perception and promotion of new ideas and orienting participants
                        in the innovation process to the final result;</span></li>
                        <li><span>leaders of innovations, including in the field of new forms of personnel labor organization
                        (adequate for innovative activities).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Managers who participate in innovative projects must have a high level of professionalism and
                        qualifications that guarantee the effectiveness of their activities. They are designed to carry
                        out business design, forecast and plan innovation processes, conduct economic analysis, identify
                        all possible risks, and find opportunities to expand the scope of their organization's
                        activities in the commodity markets.

                            Such activities involve adequate organization of people, their motivation in the results of
                            their work, their understanding of the innovative problems of the organization, its mission,
                            culture and ethics of corporate behavior. Managers themselves should be people of
                            non-standard thinking, proactive and able to generate ideas, sociable, feel the need to work
                            with the team and have the gift of influencing people, stress-resistant and balanced,
