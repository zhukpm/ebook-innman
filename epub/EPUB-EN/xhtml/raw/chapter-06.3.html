                        Strategies for selecting innovations are crucial in implementing innovation plan-projects, and
                        programs, as well as in general innovation policy. The foundation for building an organization's
                        development strategy, the starting point in this process should be an analysis of the external
                        and internal environment, which will provide the basis for the final determination of the
                        organization's innovation goals.

                    <p>
                        It is advisable to transfer the functions of developing an organization's innovation strategy to
                        its innovation division. After studying the results of the environment analysis, the innovation
                        division should set the goals of the enterprise's innovation strategy. Each goal, depending on
                        the scale and complexity of the problem, determines the emergence of one or more innovation
                        processes aimed at achieving it. Innovation policy should serve as the foundation for building
                        an organization's development strategy.

                        It is important to understand the main areas of developing an organization's behavior strategy.
                        As such, you can select:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>new markets and concentration of efforts on a limited market segment;</span></li>
                        <li><span>specialization in the production of products or technologies, development of new products and services, improvement of service for consumers;</span></li>
                        <li><span>expanding opportunities to improve product quality;</span></li>
                        <li><span>increasing the level of capitalization, increase the return on investment, profit, etc.;</span></li>
                        <li><span>achieving leadership in a specific area of innovation activity (for example, in minimizing production costs).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Each type of innovation strategy is associated with a complex pre-development. Thus, the problem
                        of developing high-tech industries should be considered in line with the achievements of leading
                        scientific organizations or industrial enterprises, regional centers of science and high
                        technologies (in the relevant industry areas).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A company's leadership can be achieved by entering the market with a principal and patented
                        invention. In some cases, the leading position of the organization is achieved by selling
                        products in combination with related services (according to the strategy of "complex sale").

                    </p>
                    <p>The following types of strategies are considered innovation:

                        <li><span><span class="font-it">offensive</span> — innovations focused on gaining space in the market;</span></li>
                        <li><span><span class="font-it">imitative</span> — acquisition of new technologies (products) under a license;</span></li>
                        <li><span><span class="font-it">traditional</span> — improving product quality;</span></li>
                        <li><span><span class="font-it">opportunistic</span> — mastering of a strategic product with relatively low research and development
                        costs;</span></li>
                        <li><span><span class="font-it">defensive</span> — does not allowing lagging behind competitors in technical and technological
                        development.</span></li>
