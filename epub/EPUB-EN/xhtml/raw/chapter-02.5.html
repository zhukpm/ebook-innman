                        Both theoretical developments and the practice of innovation management clearly indicate the absolute importance of implementing the postulates and basic values of the philosophical way of thinking in it.

                                It is enough to recall that the philosophy of an innovative organization favors:
                                - the formation among staff the creative mindset, receptivity to innovations, especially technical ones, and ability to function successfully in the dynamic and chaotic environment of global competition;
                                - the development of freedom of thinking that allows you to go beyond pragmatism, rationality and create things that "shape of heart";
                                - the perception of cognitive search as a risk-laden and individual process.

                        However, it is necessary to understand what kind of philosophy the team of an innovative organization adheres to.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The innovation management system includes:
                        - knowledge and incorporation of knowledge which recognized as an effective and regulated productive force that implies an active attitude of a person to their own knowledge in the process of implementing innovative strategies, products and technologies in the organization;
                        - justification of the need for the organization to incorporate knowledge and transform it into human capital;
                        - motivation for free exchange of opinions and knowledge between employees.

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>знания и инкорпорирование знаний, признаваемых в качестве действенной и регулируемой
                        производительной силы, предполагающей активное отношение человека к собственным знаниям в
                        процессе внедрения в организации инновационных стратегий, продуктов и технологий;</span></li>
                        <li><span>обоснование необходимости для организации инкорпорирования знаний и их трансформирования в
                        человеческий капитал;</span></li>
                        <li><span>мотивацию свободного обмена мнениями и знаниями между сотрудниками.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        According to the needs of innovation organization should be coordinated and the organizational relationships; adapt forms of internal organization of the system that denies administrative and bureaucratic type of thinking, characterized by low levels of formalization and high flexibility ("network organization", autonomous units, hetero-structures); pursue the policy focused on the development of domestic entrepreneurship.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The transition from purely technical to intellectual skills mainly determines and preconditions the formation of an innovative economy. Therefore, the terms "information society", "knowledge society", "information economy", and "intellectual economy" are not accidental.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The depth of the radical changes associated with the replacement of labor with knowledge is that it is knowledge, and not labor in the traditional sense, that begins to act as the preferred source of value multiplication. The labor theory of value is replaced by the theory of "value created by knowledge" (<span class="font-it">knowledge value</span>). As a result, the economy is becoming a system that operates on the basis of knowledge exchange and their mutual evaluation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The replacement of labor with knowledge gives reason to talk about the possible replacement of labor activity in many ways with a new type of activity, characterized by significant elements of creativity, and to raise the question of the historical perspective of "classical" labor. Recall that the founders of Marxism noted that such work with the development of society will give way to a higher type of activity.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The increased significance of the phenomenon of knowledge makes it necessary to incorporate it into the sphere of innovation management exclusively through spiritual values. This philosophy makes it possible to objectively and realistically (without any interference from new-fangled ideology) assess the patterns and prospects for the development of globalizing economic systems, within which barriers between economies of different jurisdictions should be eliminated, and national legislation should be unified and harmonized.

                            At present, a philosophy based on true spiritual values and a traditional organizational culture are urgently needed, leading to intellectual thinking and innovative approaches to developing the mission, general goal and objectives at the level of not only specific organizations, but also macroeconomics. In a changing situation, philosophy is especially valuable precisely because it allows and even encourages going beyond pragmatic thinking, using intuition, and focusing on spiritual and moral values.

                    <p>
                        Regarding the perception and assimilation of the ideas of philosophy, we can distinguish between employees:
                        - with a creative mindset and a tendency to self-improvement;
                        - who prefer to act in accordance with their own views;
                        - driven to action by external circumstances rather than internal motives, who have nothing against "going with the flow».

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>творческого склада ума и склонных к самосовершенствованию;</span></li>
                        <li><span>предпочитающих действовать в согласии с собственными взглядами;</span></li>
                        <li><span>побуждаемых к действию скорее внешними обстоятельствами, чем внутренними мотивами, не имеющих
                        ничего против того, чтобы «плыть по течению».</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The first have a philosophical way of thinking focused on the search for new ideas, reflect on corporate values, culture and ethics, and develop strategic ideas that may seem questionable or "unaffordable" at first glance, although they are useful. Others, usually the majority, adapt to the current state of Affairs, at best comment on well-known postulates, try to give new meaning to entrenched concepts and phenomena, and try to transform classical values into the realities of a market economy.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The philosophical way of thinking based on spirituality is becoming increasingly important in connection with the development of globalization processes. At the same time, a philosophy based on universal values derived from the diversity of cultures that allow integration into global economic innovation processes is essential.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important that a philosophical way of thinking based on spirituality helps to eliminate contradictions between creative and administrative tasks, as well as the effective implementation of the intellectual potential of the organization through its corporate culture. It is necessary to create favorable conditions for innovation leaders to work creatively.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A talented manager who is able to generate ideas cannot be satisfied with the position of administrator and material benefits. It needs spiritual nourishment, which is obtained, in particular, in the course of ethical relations and the use of corporate culture mechanisms. The motives and goals of a creative employee who is concerned with finding a new one, and a Manager who acts adequately to the innovative logic of the organization, without relying on spirituality, which informally unites the collective, may not only disagree with each other, but also turn out to be conflicting. If such a conflict arises in the mind of a scientific leader who simultaneously performs the functions of a Manager, then an environment may arise that can become a barrier to the development of an innovation organization.
