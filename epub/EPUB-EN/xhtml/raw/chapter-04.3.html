                        Every innovative organization carries out its activities through the implementation of its
                        inherent functions. There are many of these functions, and they are classified in a certain way.
                        We are interested in the main (or General) functions that are inherent in all organizations,
                        without which their activities are impossible.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also private and specific functions, the need for which to some extent depends on the
                        characteristics of the organization (its industry affiliation, purpose, form of ownership, size,
                        etc.).

                            In the literature, there are discrepancies in the classification of General functions, but
                            the principle of the approach is unambiguous. An innovative organization, like any other,
                            performs the functions of analysis, forecasting, planning, organization, motivation,
                            adaptation, coordination, accounting, control and evaluation. All of them together form the
                            functional structure of innovation management.

                        Let's give a brief description of some of the main control functions.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The quality of management elements and the relationships between them are closely related to how
                        the <span class="font-it">analysis function</span> is understood and performed. There are
                        various ways to perform the analysis.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basis of factor analysis is to determine the level of influence of specific factors on
                        efficiency (for example, the amount of total costs), taking into account the information
                        obtained when developing a plan of organizational and technical measures of a specific
                        innovation orientation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Economic and mathematical methods of analysis assume the choice of the most effective (optimal
                        for a given criterion) options for economic decisions in the current (planned) conditions of
                        activity. It is desirable that the analysis of implementation of managerial decisions ahead of
                        time not only current but also potential problems, which helps to identify at what stage of
                        innovation is likely to have problems, and how great may be their impact, as well as to find
                        specific ways to prevent or offset the undesirable consequences of these problems.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evaluation of work is organized based on deviations from the planned indicators with the
                        establishment of their causes and identification of unclaimed reserves. Report indicators can be
                        compared with planned indicators, planned indicators with indicators of the previous period,
                        report indicators with indicators of previous periods, and so on. Before comparing indicators,
                        you should bring them into a comparable form (unity of assessment, comparability of calendar
                        terms, elimination of the influence of differences in volume and assortment, product quality,
                        etc.).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-it">The forecasting function</span> is understood as a scientifically reasoned
                        judgment about possible alternative ways and terms of developing the subject of innovation, the
                        results of which are expressed in the forecast. The forecast is a pre-planned document
                        containing quantitative characteristics (estimates) of the management object, estimated terms,
                        volumes, costs, quality of work, and other related indicators. All of them are probabilistic and
                        need to be adjusted in the future. The purpose of forecasting is to determine scientifically
                        based (reliable) trends in the development of the innovation object, which will be used in the
                        development of strategic plans in general, but primarily in the conduct of scientific-research
                        and experimental-design works.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main tasks of forecasting are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>identification of trends (economic, scientific, technical) that can have an impact on meeting
                        the needs of consumers;</span></li>
                        <li><span>study and forecast market demand for specific types of innovation strategies, products and
                        technologies;</span></li>
                        <li><span>argumentation of the economic rationality of developing new products or improving the quality
                        of producing products in accordance with the priorities of the organization and with available
                        resources, etc.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        At the <span class="font-it">planning</span> stage, which is recognized as the most important
                        function of management, specific and reasoned goals and objectives are defined, methods and
                        means of their implementation are developed. The plan and forecast are mutually complementary
                        management stages (with the plan playing a defining role). In contrast to the forecast, the plan
                        contains no longer alternative, but unambiguous characteristics of the planned object, based on
                        a rational forecast option.

                    </p>
                    <p>The plan serves as the basis for the activities of innovative organizations of all forms of
                        ownership and size, ensuring consistency in the work of their divisions, monitoring results,
                        determining resource needs, stimulating the labor activity of employees, and analyzing the
                        results of innovative activities.

                    </p>
                    <p><span class="font-it">Coordination</span> is a function designed to ensure consistency in the
                        activities of all related parts of the organization by establishing rational communications
                        between them. Widely used means of communication (reports, consultations, meetings, documents,
                        etc.) allow you to establish links and interactions between subsystems of innovation
                        organizations, to ensure unity and harmony of all stages and functions of the management
                        process.

                        the product-innovation;</span></li>
                    <li><span>research of the resource market conjuncture, the state of the situation with competition for
                        specialized products, risk analysis and search for ways to minimize them;</span></li>
                    <li><span>forecasting activities in the context of the stage of the organization's life cycle (certain
