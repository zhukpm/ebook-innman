                            science-intensive ones, have a significant contribution to the development of innovation
                            activities. Incubators are one of the mandatory structural divisions of modern technology

                        Starting an own business entrepreneur has to solve a lot of organizational, legal, economic and
                        purely technical issues: how to conduct marketing research, register your company, and create a
                        business plan to promote new products or services on the market. Where can he find employees
                        with the necessary qualifications, office space, and interested commercial partners? And most
                        importantly, how to get highly qualified advice and informative assistance on all aspects of
                        business. Before applying for support from venture funds or any other sources of financial
                        resources, the future entrepreneur must justify the viability of the proposed project.

                        Almost all the problems of justifying the project of a business organization and then the
                        problems of its successful operation are solved by the incubator. The innovation incubator is
                        the basis of the technology park. It commercializes the results of scientific researches and
                        experimental-design works, which are carried out on preferential terms in small innovative
                        firms. Technology parks are located in technical and implementation zones, on specially selected
                        territories, where all conditions for the development of innovative activities are created.

                        The most general idea of the functions of technical and implementation zones and the main

                        The structure of the technology park is based on a modular principle, the primary element of
                        which is a small formation - an innovation incubator-company. By the way, the technology park is
                        translated as an incubator of technologies. Technology parks consist of a set of small
                        firms-centers that specialize in providing certain innovative services, and are, in turn, part

                        of innovation incubators. This zone must necessarily have a common extensive infrastructure that
                        supports their innovation and production activities.

                        The general target functions of technology polises are the formation of innovative
                        infrastructure and increase of innovative activity, structural restructuring of industry,
                        creation of new jobs, development of mechanisms for innovation, increase of innovative
                        capability and increase of innovation potential and science-intensive of industry, improvement
                        of state innovation policy.

                    <p>
                        In this system, production capacities concentrated in small innovative firms can significantly
                        increase the effectiveness of innovation activities by reducing financial costs and time spent
                        by a novice entrepreneur, paying a lower amount for renting work space and necessary equipment,
                        and joint using secretarial, computer and other services.

                        At the beginning of the activity, entrepreneurs are assisted in the field of management by the
                        incubator managers. They get access to a network of professional lawyers, accountants, marketing
                        specialists, and patent specialists who are able and willing to provide qualified assistance to
                        aspiring entrepreneurs. With comprehensive support, start-up entrepreneurs actively master
                        progressive technologies and organizational forms of management, rely on the experience of
                        professional marketers in a competitive market and, as a result, ensure the competitiveness of
                        their products.

                    <p>
                        Fees for services rendered, including rent of premises, use of equipment owned by the incubator,
                        and maintenance, are quite moderate due to the participation of the state, local authorities,
                        interested large industrial associations, universities, and other educational institutions in
                        financing and other forms of support for the incubator's activities. These circumstances, as
                        well as wide opportunities for combining the latest scientific ideas and developments with
                        production, create conditions for small businesses to actively develop their own scientific and
                        practical innovative developments in cooperation with all Federal, regional and local government
                        bodies interested in scientific and technical development, as well as large industrial
                        corporations, universities, and even individuals.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interest of large industrial associations in the fate of innovative firms is motivated by
                        the fact that the incubator serves as an excellent source of information about new promising
                        ideas or practical developments that fit into an innovative strategy for long-term development.
                        This allows you to gain time in the early stages of mastering major innovations, which gives
                        them a strategic advantage over competitors, and in addition, also significant savings in
                        financial resources. It is much cheaper to acquire the rights to use a new idea by agreeing with
                        its author or buying a large stake in the company than to start your own research and
                        development in the chosen direction.

                        in innovation business, science and production, operating on a commercial basis. Only joint
                        efforts can bring to the market a lot of original ideas and solutions that arise from inventors,
                        scientists, University teachers and employees who cannot succeed by acting independently. In
                        this case, a labor-intensive and science-intensive business gets a chance to be successfully
                        implemented and become part of the driving forces of the market economy.
