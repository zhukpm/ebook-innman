                        The development of the scientific and technical policy of an innovation organization is based on
                        the "five pillars" that are the sources of innovation:

                    <p>
                        Exploratory researches aims to identify opportunities for creating innovative products and
                        technologies, materials with new properties, and management novations. Most important are
                        fundamental researches, which able to become a generator of ideas that allow us to penetrate
                        into still unknown areas of scientific and technical activity.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Applied researches includes researches in the field of practical application of already
                        discovered phenomena and processes. The essence of this work is to solve technical problems that
                        help to increase and refine the knowledge needed to find certain final results that can be used
                        in the future in the innovation activity of the organization.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technical developments consist of design and experimental, technological, project and
                        organizational works culminating in the creation of a pilot-line production. The possibility
                        degree of obtaining the desired results from previously performed theoretical studies is
                        checked. Developments are related to the creation of prototypes (unique models with principal
                        features), new materials, products or devices, the introduction of new processes, systems and
                        services, or significant improvements to existing ones, their testing during the time required
                        to obtain technical and other data and gain experience, that should later be reflected in the
                        technical documentation on the application of innovations.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is followed by the first assimilation of innovations — technical and economic. The results
                        of innovations to the state of consumer readiness are distributed to all interested industries
                        (organizations). They can be used in scientific institutions, in experimental samples and
                        laboratory processes, in pilot-line productions, and, of course, in real practice. In short,
                        where there is a demand for them and enough funds to purchase them.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final stage is replication and dissemination of innovations. Since it is rather complex and
                        cumbersome, it is preferable to implement innovation activities through a planning system. At
                        the same time, it is important that researchers, developers, designers, technologists, design
                        organizations, manufacturers of rationalization tools, economists, and expected producers
                        cooperate and consult closely with consumers at an early stage of documentation preparation.
                        Only joint efforts can be made to find solutions and accord the implementation of tasks on the
                        content and timing of innovation realizing.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is very important to have constantly updated information about the dynamics and scientific
                        and technical sources of innovation in order to plan the organization's innovation activities,
                        select the most rational ways to apply innovations, and continuously monitor and enrich the
                        innovation portfolio. The availability of such an information base is a necessary prerequisite
                        for developing a project for technical re-equipment of an organization based on a system of
                        business plans for investment projects containing control figures for payback and profitability.

                        It is also necessary to develop in advance a system of social standards that regulate the
                        requirements for new technologies, techniques and designed machines in terms of conditions,
                        content and creative nature of work. To implement social guarantees, it is necessary to create a
                        mechanism for retraining personnel who are released as a result of the introduction of
                        scientific and technological progress.

                        The results of innovation activity are numerous and diverse in themselves. The level of resource
                        saving increases, labor productivity and capital productivity increase, material intensity,
                        energy intensity and capital intensity of products decrease, and significant changes occur in
                        the structure of the national economy and innovative organizations themselves. New technological
                        systems that ensure environmental cleanliness and safety of production are spreading faster.

                        There is a distinction between basic innovations (major inventions), which become the basis for
                        the formation of new generations (directions) of technology; improving innovations, involving
                        positive changes; rationalizing innovations, which are aimed at partial improvement of obsolete
                        generations of equipment and technology.
