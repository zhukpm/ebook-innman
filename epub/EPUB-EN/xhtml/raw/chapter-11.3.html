                        Special economic zones are one of the important organizational forms that contribute to the creation of breakthrough technologies. These zones are created and developed on budget funds and are part of the national innovation policy of the state. special economic zones include developed transport, engineering and social infrastructure. The economic effect of their creation is estimated at tens of billions of rubles. In Russia, there are four special economic zones based on science cities-in Tomsk, Dubna near Moscow, St. Petersburg and Zelenograd.

                    <p>
                        Their main tasks include:
                        - creation of basic breakthrough technologies that are the basis for the development and production of high-tech products that are competitive in foreign and domestic markets;
                        - development of innovative infrastructure;
                        - development of production and technical re-equipment of enterprises at the modern technical and technological level.

                        Participants of the special economic zone can be companies working in the field of electronics and high technologies that have passed a competitive selection. There are tax benefits in this zone. In addition, it is a center of concentration of advanced teams working on the creation of breakthrough technologies, united by a corporate culture of innovation creativity. The advantages of the special economic zone should also include the presence in its structure of centers for collective use of unique, high-tech equipment, which can be accessed by small companies engaged in breakthrough technologies.

                    <p>
                        Breakthrough technologies can be implemented through strategically important projects of socio-economic, industrial and scientific-technical development, the implementation of which guarantees major shifts in the technological transformation of domestic production, an increase in the share of competitive products of Russian enterprises in the domestic and global markets, as well as the solution of acute social problems.

                    <p>
                        A form of implementation of breakthrough technologies is also system projects for territory management. It is extremely important for Russia, where the climatic and territorial differences of the Federation are so high that development of regional territory management technologies and their integration in complex socio-technological complex at the federal level are essential for the development and preservation of the integrity of our society.
