                                <div class="ru-semantics">Internal and external theories have been developed in relation to the organization. Internal theories include the theory of needs by A. Maslow and the theory of "labor enrichment" by F. Herzberg, and external theories that develop systems of monetary incentives for effective work based on standardization of work and training personnel in methods of their implementation (a method, the basis for which was laid down by F. Taylor). In all cases, the theory's recommendations can be used to search for adequate opportunities to stimulate innovation activity. It is important that successes should be encouraged and, moreover, immediately after the work has been done.

                                <div class="ru-keyword">Theory of expectations</div>
                                <div class="ru-semantics">(expectations of how situations and possible outcomes of actions will be shaped in practice). According to this theory, the prerequisite for motivation to achieve a certain goal is the belief of the individual that the type of behavior will lead to the satisfaction of the desired outcome. This theory reflects the strong motivation of employee behavior at all levels of management.

                                <div class="ru-semantics">Human needs are divided into five categories: physiological needs (food, clothing, housing); economic security needs (high wages to save money, medical and social insurance, pension and employment guarantee schemes); social needs - a sense of belonging to a collective, desire for communication, mutual respect; Status needs - the need for recognition, a feeling of value of the person as an integral part of the whole (these needs are closely connected with the concept of status, which denotes the "importance" of man in the eyes of others); needs in self-expression - the needs of the highest order, when a person works, feeling satisfaction from the very process of work. The modern interpretation of needs satisfaction theory puts spiritual rather than physiological needs first, recognizing the metaphysical doctrine of the primacy of spirit and the secondary nature of matter.

                                <div class="ru-semantics">freedom of choice, the right to decide, autonomy. The possibility of choice is guaranteed only when the role function of the employee is clearly defined. The greatest freedom of choice is characteristic of the teams of prosperous enterprises which are characterized by shared values, an atmosphere of mutual understanding and friendliness. In their activities, they follow the rules of ethical behavior shared by all employees.
