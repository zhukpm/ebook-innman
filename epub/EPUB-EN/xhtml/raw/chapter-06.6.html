                    <p>
                        Law is a set of norms or rules of conduct that the top-manager, manager and ordinary employee
                        rely on to achieve order in the organization, ensuring the absolute priority of legality in
                        regulating managerial relations. Legal norms are binding on all organizations and individuals to
                        whom they are addressed, and their implementation can be enforced.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legal support includes various legislative and regulatory acts adopted at the federal and
                        regional levels. These acts include current federal laws, government and federal administrative
                        regulations, and state regulations and standards.

                    </p>
                    <p>Legal support is provided in the following directions:


                    </p>
                    <ol class="latin-ol">
                        <li><span>legal issues of the country's economy (development of entrepreneurship in various fields, tax
                        system, financial and credit policy, foreign economic activity);</span></li>

                    <p>Legal support for business is carried out in the form of creating and developing a commercial
                        organization's own legal service, or through the provision of services by bar associations or
                        law firms.

                    </p>
                    <p>The main tasks of legal support for the activities of an innovation organization are:
                    <ul>
                    <li><span>protection of the rights and interests of the organization in interaction with state
                        authorities, judicial and law enforcement agencies, municipalities, contractors;</span></li>

                        goal;</span></li>
                    <li><span>legal support of corporate events;</span></li>
                    <li><span>provision of legal means for the preservation and acquisition of property, improvement of the
                        quality of products (services rendered, works performed), proper performance of contractual
                        obligations;</span></li>
                    <li><span>participation in the development and implementation of measures aimed at employees' compliance
                        with current legislation and local regulations;</span></li>
                    <li><span>local rule-making and ensuring the legality of organizational and management documentation,
                        the formation of a legal culture.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All legal methods used in innovation management can be divided into several types:


                    <ul>
                    <li><span>administrative-legal, which are fixed by the norms of administrative law;</span></li>
                    <li><span>civil-legal, fixed by the norms of labor law;</span></li>
                    <li><span>labor rights stipulated by the norms of civil law;</span></li>
                    <li><span>financial-legal and other, fixed by the norms of the relevant branches of the national
                        economy.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Many innovation processes are governed by international law. This happens in cases where
                        innovative activities affect the relations of property rights, financial and economic or other
                        legitimate interests of other States.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main regulator of economic relations of an organization is a legal contract, the application
                        of which also applies to relations of intellectual property, exchange activity, banking,
                        securities circulation, insurance, use of collateral and other issues.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In real practice, there may be a shortage of legal information, especially in conditions where a
                        number of relations are not regulated by the rules of law, their multiplicity and inconsistency
                        due to frequent adjustments, as well as due to insufficient and imperfect management mechanisms.
                        All this has a negative impact on the rule of law in innovation management, provoking
                        uncertainty in law enforcement activity.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When forming the legal framework for innovation management, a systematic approach is of great
                        importance. Legal regulation applies to both the subject and the object of management, covers
                        all aspects of innovative management activities horizontally and vertically. Therefore, the acts
                        addressed to any system are in a natural relationship, which serves as a different expression of
                        the relationships of the elements that make up this system, as well as the functions of
                        innovative management activities performed by them (planning, regulation, control, etc.). Each
                        such act relating to an element of the system must be coordinated.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legal norms that in the first period after their establishment met the requirements of the
                        organization, eventually cease to meet their functional purpose. When the developing system of
                        innovative management moves to a qualitatively different state, there is a need to update
                        existing or create more advanced legal norms. The stability of the norms is ensured only in the
                        interval of the time period during which the system functioning conditions are relatively
                        constant. The dynamism of norms, expressed in their constant adaptation to a qualitatively
                        changing environment, prevents possible contradictions in the management system.

                            It is advisable to strengthen the system of legal support for innovation management in the
                            coordinates of modern trends in the development of an innovative organization. without
                            high-quality legal support of the management system, it is impossible to ensure its stable
                            and successful functioning. Each innovation organization is a subsystem of a higher
                            level-region, industry, country, and joint ventures are subsystem of the world community. If
                            each innovative organization operates according to its own legal norms, it is impossible to
                            coordinate their actions and create a higher-level system out of them.

                    <p>The use of information plays an important role in innovation management. Its basic purpose is to
                        ensure the accuracy of the formulation of problems and their environment. The information that
                        is sufficient for this purpose will also be sufficient for the subsequent development of goals
                        and alternative options for their implementation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is different when the information is insufficient and the situation is characterized by a
                        high degree of uncertainty. Sometimes the amount of information about the problem situation
                        (administrative — resolutions, orders, orders, reporting and statistical information, results of
                        observations, scientific research and experiments, expert opinions) is sufficient, while it is
                        really not enough to identify the truth or falsity of the problem formulation and its belonging
                        to a certain type.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In such a situation, two approaches are possible, depending on the personal characteristics of a
                        particular manager and the time factor. In one case, efforts will be required to obtain the
                        missing information (purchasing it for a fee, conducting special sociological surveys,
                        additional marketing), and in the other, you can abandon such attempts and make a decision in
                        the current conditions of uncertainty.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the appeal to the latter option may be dictated by economic considerations. It may
                        happen that the expected increase in the effectiveness of the solution will be less than the
                        additional time and money required to achieve it.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The availability of information, which is characterized by the measure of its acquisition
                        possibility, depends on its clarity and unambiguity of expression, price, as well as to a large
                        extent on the skill level of the recipient, his ability to adequately perceive it. The
                        information should be presented in a form that does not require additional processing, in
                        clarifications and explanations, in relation to the relevant department of management or this
                        category of employees.

                    <p>
                        In all work with information, a prominent place belongs to the information model, designed to
                        ensure a high degree of awareness of the manager. The initial basis for building the model is
                        the tasks of the corresponding organization and the technological process of their
                        implementation. The model records the composition, content and sources of information necessary
                        for the functioning of the information system the totality and sequence of management work and
                        operations, the categories of performers and the technical means used, the time standards and
                        the complexity of work.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model reflects the general scheme of formation and movement of information flows in
                        accordance with the procedures for implementing the organization's functional tasks.

                    </p>
                    <p>The development of an information system model should be preceded by a study of:


                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>first of all, such features of the organization as the nature and scope of activities,
                        organizational structure, level of specialization, manageability, and technical equipment of
                        management processes;</span></li>
                        <li><span>level of complexity of resources that specialize in working with information systems.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Information support specialists are required to isolate from the general information flow and
                        pre-process the information receiving to certain managers. To establish the parameters of the
                        required information, you need to first find out what data is really needed in accordance with
                        the features of the functional activity of the organization, input and output documents, their
                        purpose and the trajectory of movement between the divisions of the management apparatus.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The manager's information model is designed to streamline and facilitate the provision of
                        information necessary for successful decision-making at the right time and in a form that is
                        easy to understand and use. The latest technologies allow you to update information as needed
                        directly at the user's workplace (daily-via modem, weekly-on a floppy disk). At the same time,
                        the old versions are saved in the system, which makes it possible to track the current
                        legislation at any time of interest to the user.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The difference between the required and available information expresses the amount of additional
                        information needed by the relevant manager. It is important to distinguish between objective and
                        subjective need for information.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The vast majority of internal organizational communications are accounted for by information
                        exchanges between the manager and subordinates. But these communications have the property that,
                        being formally vertical, in fact they largely belong to the sphere of interpersonal, informal
                        relations.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not all managers consider it necessary to use the information potential of communication with
                        subordinates. Meanwhile, the head of the problems of their subordinates, obtaining a true
                        picture about the true situation at the team is essential ability to communicate directly with
                        employees and to be a worthy member of an informal communication.

                        The quality of communication depends, first of all, on the manager's business communication
                        skills with his employees, on his ability to maintain a conversation with them, an important
                        part of which is the ability to listen. In addition, it is necessary that the manager
                        competently manages meetings, compiles reports and writes letters, and competently expresses his
                        thoughts in order to be clearly understood by his colleagues.

                        The imperfection of the communication system is quite expensive for an innovative organization.
                        Therefore, it is clear that managers are concerned about improving communication practices by
                        creating a comfortable environment for business communication. For this purpose, convenient
                        discussion rooms and cafeterias are used, which are conducive to easy communication. Random and
                        unplanned meetings can sometimes bring more benefits to the organization than other carefully
                        prepared official meetings.

                            Special attention should be paid to organizational communications involving people with
                            different socio-psychological characters and value orientations. Communication in an
                            innovative organization is a complex multi-level system of relations that covers both the
                            organization itself, its internal communications between divisions, and the external
                            environment — relations with competitors, customers, creditors, and the tax service.
                            Internal communications, in turn, are divided into vertical and horizontal.

                        For the most part, communication problems arise in organizations in functional communication
                        with the external environment. Every organization in the process of implementing its functions
                        is in constant information interaction with the external environment — through relations with
                        controlling state bodies, suppliers and consumers, social funds, and the public. Such
                        interaction is carried out through communication links that allow an innovative organization to
                        correctly build its activity strategy and tactics, get the necessary information about the state
                        of the market and the actions of its competitors, as well as various regulatory and reference
                        data.

                    <p>
                        Internal communications (vertical and horizontal), which form the basis of the activity of an
                        innovative organization, are carried out between its divisions. Top-down message flows are more
                        frequent than bottom-up messages. Usually, top management is more likely to generate messages,
                        and besides, it is easier to transfer information from the boss to the subordinate than vice
                        versa. Vertical communications are directed "from top to bottom" and serve to convey to
                        employees information about strategic and tactical goals, as well as specific tasks, changes in
                        priorities, and performance standards. At the same time, information is transmitted in the
                        opposite direction — from the lowest levels of the hierarchy to the highest, by ascending. It
                        provides management with information about the real state of affairs, the results of decisions
                        made and difficulties encountered, and considerations for resolving them.

                        In an innovative organization, in parallel with formal or official ones, informal communications
                        also arise, based on personal, non-professional and unregulated relationships. The information
                        circulating in the sphere of informal relations, mainly represented by rumors of a greater or
                        lesser degree of reliability, can be taken into account by managers.
                    </p>
                    <p>The success of using the positive potential of informal information sources depends on the
                        ability of the Manager, who should constantly search for any opportunities to improve the
                        functioning of an innovation organization as a complex social system.
