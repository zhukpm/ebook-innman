Various methods are used to analyze the situation and select options. The most widespread are methods of mathematical statistics, game theory, probability theory, linear and non-linear programming, simulation models, graph theory, queues, mass maintenance. It is important to ensure the proper balance in the use of modern analytical methods and subjective judgments in the practice of making innovative decisions.

Types and models of innovative decisions are various, difficult and dynamic. These solutions should be made mainly in conditions of uncertainty and risk. In innovative management types and models of the made decisions depend on stages of life cycle of innovations.
