                            Every developing organization has an innovative potential that expresses the measure and
                            state of its readiness to independently generate and implement "know-how", technologies,
                            products, or effectively use "another's" inventions. The potential of each organization
                            should be sufficient to achieve the set innovation goal, for example, to implement a
                            specific project (program of innovative strategic changes). Innovation potential can consist
                            not only of major developments, but even of small changes in the product and its production
                            technology that increase labor productivity, product quality, and improve its design.

                        The state, quality and volume of innovation potential largely determines the choice of an
                        innovative strategy for the development of an organization and the system of factors and
                        conditions accompanying the innovation process.

                        It is necessary to distinguish between two main components of the process of innovative
                        development — innovative projects and innovative potential. These components should be
                        considered systematically. Federal and regional targeted scientific and technical, innovative
                        programs and projects are mostly a set of activities that are mutually linked in terms of
                        content, timing, resources, location, and actions aimed at achieving a systematic scientific and
                        innovative goal. Programs and projects make it possible to actively attract private investment
                        and purposefully coordinate the work of many organizations, corporations, industries, and
                        regions to solve the most important tasks in ensuring innovative economic growth and forming a
                        macro-technological system.

                    <p>
                        The content of an organization's innovation potential is determined by the elements that make up
                        its production and management system (fig. 1).


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The core of the organization's overall capacity is the actually potential for innovation,
                        present their piece in all its units (human, organizational, technological and
                        financial-economic), which is commensurate with capabilities.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The innovative potential of enterprises and scientific and technical organizations can be
                        measured by the selected parameters. There may be several dozen such parameters. This allows the
                        organization's management to get a reliable idea of the state of innovation potential for
                        solving specific innovative tasks. The real possibilities of solving such problems are largely
                        determined by the capacity of the organization's own innovation infrastructure.

                        As parameters of the innovation potential, indicators of the state of equipment, the
                        availability of a reserve of scientific and technical developments of an innovative type, the
                        possibility of producing a pilot batch and organizing mass production are used. Special
                        attention is paid to studying and evaluating external factors that affect the organization's
                        innovation activity and, above all, the demand for its products in the market. As for internal
                        factors, they include those that characterize the level of training and qualifications of the
                        organization's personnel in certain areas of its activities.

                    <p>
                        It is necessary to determine the impact of each of the main factors, since without proper
                        consideration, for example, the state of equipment and the qualifications of the organization's
                        personnel, the possibilities of its innovation activities are significantly limited. Filling
                        each of the main factors with specific content allows us to develop models of organizational,
                        technological and infrastructure support for the innovative potential of organizations.
