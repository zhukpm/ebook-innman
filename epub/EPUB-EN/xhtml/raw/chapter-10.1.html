                            All the functions of innovation management, which make up a single unbroken chain of
                            activity of the head, are equally important, but still the most significant among them is
                            the adoption of managerial decisions. This function seems to absorb the entire management
                            process, completing it after appropriate adjustments, and its quality and effectiveness are
                            the most important components of the success of a modern organization. In innovation
                            management, decision-making is objectively associated with risk and high responsibility,
                            requires a competent, creative approach and adequate information and legal support. At the
                            same time, the specifics of the management object as an innovation one that needs
                            significant investments, large-scale marketing and qualified scientific and technical
                            personnel should be fully taken into account. Persons involved in decision-making must be
                            able to analyze all options and choose the final one, have knowledge of the stages,
                            procedures and all the subtleties of decision-making technology and other necessary
                            qualities.

                    <p>Each innovation solution is creative and unique in nature. More and more decisions are based on
                        subconscious deep thinking processes and are intuitive. It is also important to note that
                        innovation solutions largely depend on information support and constant monitoring of changing
                        external environmental characteristics.

                    <p>
                        The process of making an innovation decision is preceded by the identification of the problem
                        situation and its analysis. For each situation, several innovation solutions should be
                        developed, from the totality of which the one that can provide the best results is selected.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An innovation organization must be constantly ready to make informed innovation solutions at all
                        levels of the management hierarchy. In essence, the solution is designed to mobilize and focus
                        all available resources to transfer the organization to a better state (in accordance with its
                        goals and objectives). Everything that is done in an innovation organization appears as a
                        consequence of the implementation of innovation solutions that form the content of the
                        management process. It is innovation management solutions that allow us to achieve not only
                        efficiency in production, but also to detect the creative activity of outstanding personalities.

                        The degree of validity of the innovative decision by the manager largely determines the results
                        of the innovation activity of the entire team and its own well-being. the staff of the
                        organization reacts negatively to unsuccessful decisions that reduce its prestige, worsen the
                        material and social conditions of life axtivity. The decisions of the manager also affect the
                        state of affairs in other organizations that are in cooperation with her.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every decision is aimed at eliminating the existing conflicts and contradictions in the
                        innovation organization of the economic, socio-psychological or organizational order. There is a
                        need for this in any organization, but it is especially significant in an innovative type of
                        organization that claims to create breakthrough technologies.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the process of developing and making innovation decisions, the role of the manager is very
                        clearly manifested. Through solutions, the focus of the organization's activity is determined,
                        and its goals are transformed into concrete results.

                            When working on innovation solutions, various external and internal factors interact. The
                            more complex the situation, the more clearly the "personal profile of the decision" is
                            manifested, which is determined by the totality of the manager's quality—his psychological
                            features education, experience, age, and internal goals. Equally important are the
                            conditions for the functioning of the production and social environment, the properties of
                            the problems being implemented, the level of technical equipment, and the availability of
                            information sources.

                        Until recently, traditional organizational management structures were characterized by systems
                        that are configured to make mostly individual decisions. In the changed environment, models
                        focused on group solutions of an innovation orientation should dominate (to an increasing
                        extent), in the development of which management teams consisting of intellectual labor workers
                        take part. It is necessary to constantly improve the ways of involving the organization's
                        personnel in the technologies of making intellectual decisions.

                    <p>
                        There is a great need to develop and adopt balanced innovation solutions based on a systematic
                        approach that significantly reduces the risks of their implementation. The emerging risks cannot
                        be eliminated without the active and interested participation of the organization's staff. We
                        should not forget that the management process begins with decisions, and therefore their quality
                        determines the success of management as a whole.

                            <p>The quality of an innovation solution is directly dependent on how fully the basic
                                universal requirements for its content are met:
                            </p>

                        With the increasing number and complexity of innovation solutions, the probability of
                        contradictions between them (interdependent and interacting) increases. This reveals the
                        fact that every decision is part of the system of decisions and therefore it must be
                        consistent with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>An indispensable general requirement for innovation management solutions is the development of a
                        certain number of their variants. The analysis of a problem situation of any type is reduced,
                        according to quite objective circumstances, to the consideration of a certain set of different
                        options for its resolution, followed by a comparative assessment of them in order to choose the
                        most acceptable one. Each option should be considered as a conjugate solution, as part of the
                        whole.
                    </p>

                    <p>Each innovation solution must have the necessary completeness, a clear indication of the goal,
                        specific deadlines, the main ways and means of its implementation. It is necessary to know the
                        essence of the problem situation under consideration, to identify the goal, to provide
                        flexibility and legal protection of the solution, to provide motivation for employees in its
                        adoption and execution. To transform an innovation solution into a real actuality, it must be
                        timely, alternative, authentic, targeted, consistent, eligible and directive.</p>
