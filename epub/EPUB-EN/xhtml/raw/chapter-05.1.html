                        The level of use of the intellectual potential of an organization, as well as the possibilities
                        of its enrichment, are largely dependent on the quality of its organizational structure. The
                        structure should be simple and clear, have a minimum number of intermediate links in its
                        composition, have qualified personnel focused on innovation activity, who are aware of the
                        constant need to introduce innovations into the organizational structure itself.

                    <p>
                        To ensure that the organizational structure meets the requirements of a continuously developing
                        innovation organization, it must create permanent conditions for the emergence of innovative
                        ideas that contribute to the penetration of innovations into existing organizational rules and
                        processes, and their consolidation as components of the organization's work.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Improving the management system on an innovation basis should be a constant process, a mandatory
                        subject of the organization's strategy. There are no other ways to formulate and solve the
                        problems of a modern organization in a qualified and rational way.

                        A flexible innovation processes management system that focuses on the development of promising
                        products and the restructuring of organizational forms of management, encourages the creation
                        and implementation of innovations and provides end-to-end management of the innovation process
                        (from the origin of the idea to its implementation). It provides services and departments that
                        manage innovations, dispersed at different levels of the management hierarchy, united by an
                        established system of interaction.

                    <p>
                        The absence of strict regulation of rights and responsibilities at each level of management
                        should facilitate the free flow of ideas and proposals "from the bottom up", the real interest
                        of employees at any level in discussing and developing decisions, and the implementation of a
                        unified internal organizational policy, and without information overload of the top echelon of
                        management.

                        In contrast to the vertical structure, the horizontal management structure helps to avoid
                        irrational costs, helps to mobilize all the resources of the organization, allows you to quickly
                        adapt to changing market requirements, and promotes the acceleration of the "research -
                        production - sales" process.

                    <p>
                        Organizational forms of management of innovation processes are very diverse due to the extreme
                        diversity of the innovation objects (processes), goals and activity directions of innovative
                        organizations. They are usually represented by specialized business organizations or divisions.
                        Let's name some of them (the most common):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>central services for the mastering of new products (departments of new products) that

                        and programs of innovation activity. They monitor the development of new products and their
                        implementation, and consider projects for creating new products;</span></li>
                        <li><span>design and target groups for scientific research, product development and production
                        (independent divisions created for the integrated implementation of the innovation process from
                        the idea to the mass production of the product);</span></li>

                        <li><span>venture divisions organized in large companies based on "risk capital" funds. Venture capital
                        funds are often invested in small start-up firms that are later absorbed by large ones, or
                        long-term links are established with them;</span></li>
                        <li><span>specialized centralized innovation incentive funds that are created at the expense of a
                        portion of the firm's profit. They are used to accelerate the introduction of new products into
                        mass production; development centers are independent divisions that are not related to the main
                        field of activity of the organization. For them, such indicators of economic activity are
                        established that at the stage of introducing new products stimulate the expansion of sales and
                        help to gain market positions;</span></li>
                        <li><span>funds to encourage innovation in production units. They are created to encourage Research and
                        Advanced Development with applicable nature;</span></li>
                        <li><span>consulting and analytical groups whose functions include forecasting technology development
                        and demand for new products, selecting promising ideas, defining research topics and
                        coordinating work;</span></li>
                        <li><span>temporary target groups for integrated solutions to innovation problems;</span></li>

                        There are various forms of scientific and technical cooperation in innovation between
                        organizations.

                        exchange of technologies of manufactured products, participation in the implementation of the
                        life cycle of the organization (product). As a contribution to the authorized capital, the
                        cooperating parties can make their own inventions, "know-how" and other scientific and technical
                        developments.

                        can be purchased from a third party (participant) of the cooperation.

                    <p><span class="font-it">Construction of a "turnkey" enterprise</span> is a form of exchange
                        (implementation) of an innovative product (technology), when the transferring party assumes the

                    <p><span class="font-it">Franchising</span> is a form of contractual relationship that occurs
                        between independent organizations based on trade in goods, technologies, or services. In

                        granted a temporary right to use the product. The agreement provides for the provision of

                        into a single Corporation. Other forms of scientific and technical cooperation in innovation are
