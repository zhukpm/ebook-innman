                                        Mixedness of economy is shown and realized in the market mechanism of self-regulation and is supplemented with conscious influence of state institutes on those economic and social processes where the market gives "misfires", and effective reaction of civil society institutes to "misfires" not only of the market, but also of state authorities and management bodies correcting them. Mixed economy primarily relies on the price system for its organization, but at the same time uses the diversity of government intervention to cope with macro-economic instability and market failures.

An individual employee should subordinate his or her interests to the interests of the group that requires loyalty from its members and rewards them for this loyalty. Consent within the group is on the first place. Much effort and time is spent to achieve intra-group consensus. This management model does not allow competition within a group; it exists between groups. It is the group, not an individual employee, who is rewarded for success. There is a principle: one for all and all for one.
