Strategies to build organizations are influenced by culture. American, British, Japanese and Chinese organizations have their own ways of shaping strategies based on the characteristics of national cultures and their role in realizing their goals. In some cases, the formation of multinational organizations is dominated by the culture of their country of origin; in others, the corporate culture introduced by migration essentially coincides with the national culture; and in a third case, cultures are fused on the basis of universally recognized, universal values.

The resulting environment of communication contributes to the expansion of the space of creativity and the creation of conditions for self-realization of partners in corporate activities. It is based on traditions stemming from universal values that embody the values of culture of the multinational Russian people, unite people and help each member of the team to be aware of their commonality with others. The corporate culture is formed, among other things, when events relating to each member of the team are celebrated together. This creates an informal atmosphere that brings people together. This enriches intra-organizational communication and communication with the external environment, and social and work-related problems are resolved more quickly. The organization creates an environment which, in all its manifestations, promotes trust in each other, creativity and, as a consequence, innovation.
