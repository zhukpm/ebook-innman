                        The development of the motivational aspect of an innovation organization, the formation of a new
                        system of values and remuneration of its personnel become powerful prerequisites for innovation
                        activity. There is an obvious need for new approaches to the problem of motivation, given that
                        we are talking mainly about intellectual work. It is also very important for managers to think
                        about the interests of the shareholders of an innovation organization.

                                For the development of an innovation organization, the following motives can be
                                recommended for use:

                                <li><span>meeting special needs.</span></li>

                        All the variety of complementary motives should be focused on specific innovations, the carriers
                        of which are creative workers associated with the technical preparation of the production
                        process (projecting, designing, technology), experimental and main production. They also manage
                        the process of creating organizational, technological and qualification prerequisites for the
                        development of creative activity, are concerned with the constant increase in the creative
                        activity of staff.

                    <p>
                        The current system of remuneration and bonuses for managers is practically unrelated to the
                        interests and objectives of a joint-stock company (firm, enterprise). In most state-owned
                        joint-stock enterprises, official salaries are set in a certain ratio either to the tariff rate
                        of a worker of the main profession of the 1st category, or to the average salary of employees.
                        At the same time, the incentive fund used to reward managers is at their full disposal.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, in most cases, the remuneration of the head is determined by the contract. It
                        necessarily provides for all guaranteed and compensatory payments established by the Labor Code,
                        as well as fixed in the collective agreement and the industry tariff agreement. But the contract
                        should at least reflect two points: the amount of remuneration of the head and the results of
                        the activities of the unit entrusted to him, which are very interesting to the owner. However,
                        the second point in the contract, as a rule, is missing.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, in order for the contract not to be one-sided and take into account the results of
                        the company's work, it is also necessary to specify:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>requirements for ensuring production activities (volume, structure and nomenclature of
                        products);</span></li>
                        <li><span>the most important quality indicators (labor productivity, profitability, profit, production
                        costs, product competitiveness);</span></li>
                        <li><span>parameters of production potential, progressiveness of equipment, technology, energy intensity
                        of production, material intensity and resource intensity, etc.;</span></li>
                        <li><span>indicators of human resources development (the need and provision of highly qualified
                        specialists, the ratio of the actual and normative number of specialists and managers, etc.).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Shareholders are generally concerned that there is adequate incentive for the management team.
                        At the same time, the subjects of special attention are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>absolute level of remuneration;</span></li>
                        <li><span>the ratio between the income of the administration and the annual income of shareholders;</span></li>
                        <li><span>conclusion of alternative administration remuneration agreements;</span></li>
                        <li><span>use of share options to reward managers — granting the right to purchase shares at a reduced
                        price;</span></li>
                        <li><span>establishing the dependence of remuneration on takeovers and acquisitions;</span></li>
                        <li><span>the ratio of supply and demand in the market of administrative talents, etc.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, the first manager, on whom the well-being of the enterprise primarily depends, is
                        financially rewarded much higher than other managers. He must be a person who is financially
                        independent. In Russia, the remuneration of managers of all ranks differs significantly from the
                        average. However, the "separation" of this category of workers from all others is much greater
                        than it is provided for by all possible models.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, in developed countries, there is a special set of measures designed to protect
                        managers in difficult situations associated with the risky nature of their activities, in order
                        to preserve qualified management personnel, on which the success of the organization's
                        innovation activity primarily depends.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our current models retain a variety of different types of bonuses, surcharges and allowances
                        that are loosely related to the employee's labor contribution, which complicates the mechanism
                        of their organization and does not contribute to achieving a closer correspondence between the
                        labor measure and the payment measure. All this makes it necessary to find new approaches to the
                        organization of remuneration of employees of an innovation organization.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no doubt that incentives should be targeted at specific employees. Rewards for
                        innovative ideas should be promoted more widely. The administrations of many organizations
                        regularly, usually once a year, hold contests of ideas about the possibilities of creating a new
                        business. Developments that are recognized as promising are implemented, and their
                        implementation is entrusted to the initiator of the idea, who becomes the head of the newly
                        appeared company. All the ideas put forward add additional points to his work biography.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In recent years, merit-based wage individualization has become widespread in many countries.
                        Employees who have the same qualifications and occupy the same position, due to their natural
                        abilities, experience, goals and motives, can achieve different results in their work, which
                        should be reflected in wages. This is achieved by differentiating salaries within the category
                        (or position).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The practice of using merit assessment indicates an increase in the number of employees to whom
                        it applies. In the beginning, the assessment of merit was used in the organization of salaries
                        of engineering staff workers, managers and employees, whose work results are difficult to
                        express with the help of any accurate indicators. With the objective convergence of the content
                        of the work of mental and physical workers, there is a convergence and methods of payment.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is considered desirable that the manager should reward the employee for special merits and
                        performance as soon as possible after the work is completed. The fact is that people with high
                        adaptability quickly get used to the stereotypical incentive system. The person ceases to
                        respond to the expected positive reinforcement, and that is why it largely, if not completely,
                        loses its motivating potential. Moreover, if for any reason, even if it is quite justified, the
                        expected encouragement is not received, then for the most part it is perceived as a
                        manifestation of injustice and causes negative emotions in the "deprived". And, on the contrary,
                        with unexpected encouragement, the employee is convinced that his extraordinary success is not
                        only noticed, but also significantly rewarded. Rewards of this kind have a noticeable motivating
                        effect even on people who are accustomed to achievements and rewards (and the method of material
                        encouragement itself can have a greater motivating effect on the employee than its absolute
                        value).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, the success of innovation activity largely depends on understanding the fundamental
                        principles of staff motivation. It is important that the manager does not just communicate his
                        ideas about these principles, but also has a mechanism for their implementation in the daily
                        activities of the innovation organization.

                                In the vast aggregate, we will highlight the following important principles:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                qualities of employees;</span></li>
                                <li><span>priority of positive support. Positive support is more effective than negative
                                reinforcement, and its method and form are more motivating than the immediate value;</span></li>
                                <li><span>the urgency of the reward. Support should be immediate, which is expressed in an
                                immediate and fair response to the actions of employees;</span></li>
                                <li><span>incentive based on intermediate results. Employees should be rewarded for intermediate
                                achievements, without waiting for the completion of all work. It is important to keep in
                                mind that great successes are difficult to achieve, and therefore they relatively rare.
                                Therefore, it is desirable to reinforce positive motivation at not too long intervals.
                                But to do this, the overall task should be divided and planned in stages in such a way
                                that each of them can be given an adequate assessment and proper remuneration,
                                corresponding to the volume of work actually performed;</span></li>
                                <li><span>unexpected rewards. Unexpected, unpredictable, and irregular rewards are more
                                motivating than predicted when they practically become part of the salary.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        The completed work and the unexpected payment for it should not be separated by too large a
                        period of time, because the larger the time interval, the smaller the effect. immediate rewards
                        can come in many forms (for example, T. Watson, the president of IBM, was in the habit of
                        writing checks to employees during on-the-spot job rounds).

                        Special attention should be paid to the motivation of managers for creative activity, the
                        development of innovative activities. To do this, it is necessary to analyze the motivational
                        factors that affect the manager's attitude to the renewal of production, to know what
                        motivational factors affect them.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The knowledge of these factors is the starting point for solving the problem of creating
                        conditions that contribute to the implementation of strategic plans for the introduction of
                        innovations (taking into account the activities of specific individuals and the real situation
                        in the field of novations in an innovation organization).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All the motivational factors discussed above are mutually dependent. They are elements of a
                        system in which managers make decisions that contribute to the development of the organization
                        based on the dynamic introduction of innovative products and technologies. It is important to
                        realistically assess the impact of factors, taking into account the specific conditions of their
                        application.

                    </p>
                    <p>The top management of an innovation organization should regularly analyze and respond
                        appropriately to motivational factors and focus on long-term and short-term activities that
                        support the real interest and activity of the organization's staff in implementing its
                        innovation policy.
