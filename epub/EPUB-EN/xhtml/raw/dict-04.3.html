There are private and specific functions, necessity of which depends on peculiarities of organization (its affiliation, purpose, ownership form, size, etc.). The innovative organization, as any other, carries out general functions of analysis, forecasting, planning, organization, motivation, adaptation, coordination, account, control and estimation. All of them in aggregate make up functional structure of innovative management.

The most common methods are comparative analysis, factor analysis and economic-mathematical methods. Comparative analysis reveals the differences among comparable objects of the innovations. The method of factor analysis is characterized by the fact that it is based on determining the level of influence of specific factors on the efficiency. Economical and mathematical methods of analysis are supposed to select the most efficient (optimal by a given criterion) variants of economic decisions in existing (planned) conditions of activity.

Forecast serves as a pre-planning document that contains quantitative characteristics (estimates) of the object of management, the expected timing, volumes, costs, quality of work and other related indicators. All of them are probabilistic and further need to be adjusted.

The purpose is realized through the main tasks of forecasting: determination of tendencies (economic, scientific, technical), capable to influence satisfaction of needs of consumers; study and forecast of market demand.

The plan and the forecast are mutually complementary stages of management (with the defining role of the plan). Unlike the forecast, the plan contains not alternative, but unequivocal characteristics of the planned object, based on rational forecast variant. The plan serves as a basis of innovative organizations activity, providing coordinated work of their subdivisions and determination of need in resources.

Widely used means of communication (reports, meetings, conferences, documents, etc.) allow to establish links and interactions between subsystems of innovative organizations, to ensure the unity and coherence of all stages and functions of the management process.
