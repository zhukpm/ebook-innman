                            The main social function of the production and economic sphere is to meet the material needs
                            of the population (if possible in an innovative way). Without interaction with the
                            authorities, designed to create conditions for this, and certain relations with the society,
                            for the sake of which this sphere functions, its activities are impossible. The function of
                            satisfying material needs is performed by the subjects of production and economic activity
                            (i.e. enterprises of various forms of ownership and management, and personally -
                            entrepreneurs who act as carriers of innovative ideas).<span class="footnote">3</span>.

                        In a market economy, this area is represented by business structures and the business community
                        as a whole. As an explicit function of the entrepreneur (entrepreneur-private owner), as well as
                        individual, and to some extent associated (joint-stock, cooperative, collective), the function
                        of profit maximization acts. However, as Adam Smith observed, it is not the generosity of the
                        butcher, brewer, or Baker that we count on when we look forward to our dinner, but the fact that
                        he, pursuing his own special interest and guided by an invisible hand, achieves results that
                        were not even his intention. This result is a satisfied effective demand, as a hidden social
                        function of the entrepreneur.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An entrepreneur can maximize profit only by reinvesting a certain part of it in the expanded
                        reproduction of individual (private) capital, which in turn is an element of public national
                        capital. Thus, the effective implementation of main function of business (profit maximization)
                        coupled in production growth of the entire social capital in its money form, increasing of
                        production volume of gross social product. This means that the main function of profit
                        maximization is coupled with the hidden social function of expanded reproduction of social
                        capital through expanded reproduction of individual (private) capital. Profit maximization is
                        also achieved by optimal combination of such basic factors of production (means used in the
                        production of goods) as land, labor and capital, the functioning of which requires special
                        technologies and mechanisms of interaction with the government, business and society and taking
                        into account not only the purely economic, but also the social interests of the participants in
                        this process.

                    <p>
                        Recently, another specific factor of modern production has been singled out — information.
                        Information is an ordered system of knowledge and dates used in economic processes that requires
                        time and other resources to search for and obtain. With the development of the scientific and
                        technological revolution, the flow of information and its role in the economy has increased
                        significantly, which has made it possible to use information as the most important object of
                        innovation management in the context of digitalization, the development of machine learning, and
                        artificial intelligence.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to maximize profit, the mentioned production factors should be connected and interact
                        in the most effective way, i.e. their optimal combination should be achieved on an innovative
                        basis (selection and implementation of new technical, technological and organizational solutions
                        in the production process, as well as taking into account the social consequences of economic
                        growth). Due to these circumstances, entrepreneurial ability acts as a resource of a special
                        kind. Entrepreneurial abilities are specific abilities of a person that allow them to find and
                        use the best combination of resources in the production process, create and apply novelties,
                        take reasonable risks, while preserving and improving the human habitation environment. To do
                        this, the entrepreneur must be the owner in the full sense of the word, caring not only for the
                        well-being of his own business, but also for the preservation of the habitation environment in
                        which his farm operates, including nature, lifestyle, traditions and culture.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result is the optimum combination of implementation of the main private function of business
                        (maximize profits by reducing costs) and rational use of labor, natural and intellectual
                        resources, the transition to innovative type of economy development and its new quality of
                        growth in saved surrounded by the culture of the peoplehood.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is the presence of these hidden social functions that makes the entrepreneur figure dominant
                        in the market economy, which is very effective in comparison with other well-known models of
                        organizing the economic life activity of society. The entrepreneur differs from a simple robber
                        in that his desire to increase his own capital is directly associated with the growth of public
                        capital in its natural-material and value dimensions. The state as part of the implementation of
                        its basic function (ensuring a balance of interests in society) it is intended to assist
                        entrepreneurs in performing hidden social functions in every possible way, and to prevent them
                        from being suppressed by main functions of private nature. At the same time, it is very
                        important to skillfully build relations between business, the government and society on the
                        basis of mutual dependence in order to achieve a balance of interests in the most rational and
                        innovative way.
