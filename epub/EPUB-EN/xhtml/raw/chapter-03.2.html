                        Innovation activity itself is an innovation process — the process of transforming scientific and
                        technical knowledge into innovation, when in a sequential chain of events starting with a new
                        idea, it matures, is embodied in a specific product, technology or service form, and then
                        spreads through the practical use of the results. Consequently, new knowledge and experience in
                        the innovation process are translated into innovative strategies, products and technologies.
                        However, innovation processes can be considered not only as focused on the creation of a new
                        product or technology (discoveries, inventions, and generally "know-how"), but also as an
                        activity that results in the commercial sale of a new product (technique, products, materials),
                        technologies, including new methods of organizing and managing production.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The innovation process does not end with the introduction (appearance on the market) of a new
                        product and technology. As the spread (diffusion) of innovations, it continues to improve, to
                        discover previously unknown consumer properties, is becoming more efficient.

                        It is important to properly understand the structure of the innovation process and to
                        distinguish more clearly the successive stages of its dynamics. The quality of judgments about
                        such a structure will depend on the tools used to regulate it, on what there are used:


                    </p>

                        <li><span>socio-economic and scientific-technical forecasts of state policy in the field of finance,
                        prices, monetary circulation, reproduction and structural policy, etc.;</span></li>
                        <li><span>state-administrative, general economic and market regulators;</span></li>
                        <li><span>national and regional innovation systems that ensure the replenishment and effective use of
                        scientific and technical potential, expanded reproduction of innovations, primarily for the
                        sphere of material production, capable of self-development in changing conditions;</span></li>
                        <li><span>mechanisms of state regulation of scientific, technical and innovative activities, including
                        motivational, regulatory and other blocks;</span></li>

                        innovative activities at all levels of the economy (from the organization to the macro level);</span></li>
                        <li><span>forms and processes of constant updating of human and intellectual resources that can ensure
                        the full functioning of all types of innovation activity and processes of innovation management,

                    <p>
                        The main types of innovation activity can be grouped as follows:

                        <li><span>preparation and organization of production — acquisition of equipment and tools required in

                        <li><span>pre-production developments — modification of the implementing product and technologies that
                        correspond to the training of personnel (existing or staff recruitment);</span></li>
                        <li><span>production design — preparation of plans and technical documentation used in the development
                        of technical specifications and production processes, purchase of equipment necessary for the
                        implementation of product (process) innovations;</span></li>
                        <li><span>acquisition of non-materialized technology (technologies-patents, licenses, "know-how",
                        brands, trademarks and other services), the need for which arises with the advent of intelligent
                        technologies;</span></li>
                        <li><span>marketing of innovation processes (advertising campaign, market research, product adaptation
                        to different markets and consumer groups, etc.).</span></li>

                            Innovation activity, therefore, involves an extensive range of scientific, technological,
                            organizational, financial and commercial activities, and as such is a continuation of
                            scientific and technical activities in a single scientific and innovative cycle. In General,
                            the types of innovation activities are innumerable, they are in principle present in every
                            developing system and at all its levels, since this is the condition for its viability. The
                            types of innovative activity include everything that concerns the creation and improvement
                            of any component of an innovative organization.
