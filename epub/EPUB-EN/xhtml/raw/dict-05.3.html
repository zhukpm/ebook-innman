The structure of a technology park is characterized by a set of small but various firms - centers specialized in providing certain innovative services, which in their turn are a part of technopolis (research, innovative (scientific and technical complex), marketing, training center), and an industrial area. It is based on modular principle, the primary element of which is a small formation - an innovative firm-incubator.
