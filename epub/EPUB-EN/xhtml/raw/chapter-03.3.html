                        The results of the innovation process are expressed in certain indicators that reflect the
                        mission of the organization, its goals and planned calculations (financial, technical and
                        technological, economic, quantitative, qualitative (non-material), etc.). However, there is a
                        need for an indicator that can be used as a universal indicator that can provide an overall
                        assessment of innovation. In our opinion, this function can be performed by an indicator that
                        characterizes the competitive advantage of an innovative organization.

                            Competitive advantages are achieved on the basis of a strategy of aggressive market actions
                            aimed at superiority in innovation activity over their competitors. The guarantee of success
                            can be a purposeful intensification of scientific and research works, which allows
                            innovative organizations to put forward new product concepts, apply the latest flexible
                            technologies, quickly remove outdated products from the market, ensure high rates of
                            restructuring of production and sales lines, quickly enter new markets, and focus on solving
                            the problems of selected consumer groups.

                        Let's get acquainted with the main types of competitive advantages, as well as with the
                        conditions that create them.

                        A competitive advantage can become the product itself and even its single characteristics that
                        are attractive to the consumer. Very often, this characteristic is the price of the product,
                        when the consumer purchases it cheaper than other products that have similar consumer
                        properties. Under this strategy, the focus of the organization (during development and
                        production of the product) is to achieve benefits in costs, in particular due to cheaper
                        production and marketing of products, the synergistic effect (occurring in the manufacture of
                        various products), economies of scale (volume) - production (when costs are reduced per unit of
                        production), optimization of intra-organizational links, ordering (integration) distribution
                        systems and supply systems.

                        Competitive advantages can be achieved through a strategy focused on a specific (specific)
                        segment by setting low prices or by other methods that involve tighter control over the movement
                        of various groups of products designed to meet specific needs (for example, in services). The
                        product or technology of its implementation may be given some consumer properties that are
                        evaluated as improving quality, in other cases-increasing the reliability of the product in
                        operation. This is often achieved by setting up sales of products with related services, etc.

                    <p>
                        Competitive advantages are also gained by the strategy of introducing their products and
                        developing new markets at the same time. This strategy is quite risky, requiring a masterly
                        possession of marketing techniques, but at the same time it promises to master high positions in
                        the competition if successful.

                                The factors of an organization's competitiveness are changeable and do not allow it to
                                retain competitive advantages for a long time, which are associated with the
                                implementation of ever-increasing changes in innovative strategies, products and
                                technologies. The best way to solve the problem of creating and retaining competitive
                                advantages is through the qualified interaction of three subjects of the market
                                environment:

                            </p>

                                particular need, as the product of the first organization.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        The buyer will have to make a choice, which may not be easy. After all, a competitive advantage
                        is nothing more than the value inherent in an innovative product for the buyer. Meanwhile, in a
                        situation of choice, consumers ' understanding of the value of a product may differ
                        significantly.
