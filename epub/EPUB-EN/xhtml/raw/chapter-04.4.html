                        Innovation activity requires managers (employees) who have creative abilities and are able to
                        generate original ideas. The manager responsible for the innovation project (program) is obliged
                        to unite, inspire and direct the actions of the team.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is very important to choose participants in innovation processes who must have broad views,
                        be receptive to innovative ideas, be alien to stereotypes, be unbiased, and be accustomed to
                        working in a team. Outside experts who are able and willing to provide real assistance to an
                        innovative organization can be invited to participate in the activities of innovation groups. Of
                        particular importance is the ability to work with enthusiasm, but calmly and without excessive
                        stress.

                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, it is impossible to overestimate the role of an innovative leader who develops
                        innovative strategies, searches for acceptable organizational forms of their implementation, and
                        interests all staff in innovation. At one time, the desire for innovation activity of such
                        well-known managers as Bill Gates of <span class="font-it">Microsoft</span>, Akio Morita of
                        <span class="font-it">Sony</span>, Jack Welch of <span class="font-it">General Electric</span>,
                        led their companies to world leadership.</p>

                            Promising innovative technologies have a chance to be realized only if they are managed by a
                            staff with the appropriate intellectual potential, a culture of continuous renewal and
                            technological breakthrough, focusing on values such as shared creativity and commitment to
                            higher goals, and experiencing satisfaction and pride in a job well done.

                    <p> There are many recommendations regarding the list of desirable qualities of a leader. All of
                        them are fair and none of them is objectionable, rather they complement each other. As a typical
                        example, we will refer to G. Rolland, author of the book "Time of leaders", who highlights a
                        number of principles of a leader's activity that ensure success.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being a leader means:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>taking on the role of "obstetrician" in relation to other people's abilities;</span></li>
                        <li><span>learning from your mistakes;</span></li>
                        <li><span>developing the ability to think complex and strategically;</span></li>
                        <li><span>being able to take risks, learn new things, and clearly assess own resources;</span></li>
                        <li><span>perceiving other ways of thinking and behaving other than your own, being able to change and
                        adapt;</span></li>
                        <li><span>mobilizing and organizing people in accordance with existing norms and attitudes.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In an innovation organization, nothing is more important than leadership. No single factor
                        affects the success of an organization as much as the understanding and commitment of management
                        to the idea of leadership, which is evaluated as the main and rare resource of the organization.
                        With the progress of globalizing structures, the place of leaders-bosses should be replaced by
                        leaders of a new generation — with a new way of thinking, innovative management culture and
                        ethical values.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also note that the analysis of leadership theories shows that none of them fully meets the
                        requirements of an innovative organization. At the same time, it is generally recognized that
                        authoritarian governance has been replaced (over time) by democratic governance.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an innovative organization, there is an absolute need for democratic governance, for
                        minimizing vertical hierarchical links, and for replacing them with horizontal links between
                        teams and functional divisions. By eliminating hierarchical relationships and improving
                        bottom-up relationships, managers can be transformed from supervisors to team coordinators,
                        experts, and associates who can perform non-hierarchical organizational functions. At the same
                        time, the defining function of the leader is seen in creating conditions in which the goals set
                        become common and the entire team is distinguished by a high level of expectations in terms of
                        achieving them.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The essential difference between organizations of different forms of ownership and social
                        orientation should not be overlooked in the discussion of leadership, since the leadership
                        features required for their effective functioning are also very specific.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most often, organizations suffer from an excess of administrative management and a lack of
                        leadership. And there is an explanation for this. In the past, with an excessively formalized
                        management system and an ideologized environment, the opportunities to use the potential of
                        leadership were limited. A peculiar understanding of performance, which excludes any freedom of
                        action in the development of decisions ("do as you are told"), did not encourage people to think
                        independently.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is necessary to dramatically increase efforts to develop leadership in innovative
                        organizations. It is important to find ways to eliminate contradictions between the leader's
                        behavior and employees ' value expectations, so that the adopted innovative vision does not lose
                        its appeal, and the leader does not lose confidence.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As already noted, there is no generally accepted position regarding the required qualities of an
                        innovative leader. R. Stogdill, after reviewing more than a hundred special studies, found that
                        none of them contained clear evidence of the essential qualities of leaders. And this is natural
                        for many objective reasons, including the fact that at different stages of development, the team
                        will need different types of leaders. The qualities that are recognized as the best for a
                        particular stage can also be justified at other stages in certain situations. Yet at each stage,
                        the dominant role of certain traits of the leader is obvious.

                                The following components of leadership need the most attention:

                                work, disclosure of the natural source of energy within each employee, elimination of
                                all possible obstacles to the application of his creative forces;</span></li>
                                <li><span>free circulation and exchange of ideas between employees and structural divisions at

                                <li><span>the ability of a leader to ignite enthusiasm so that employees accept a challenge that
                                should not be too weak (then no one will strain) and not too strong (then there is no
                                point in straining);</span></li>

                    <p>
                        These variables are characteristic of a democratic leader, as opposed to managers who insist on
                        strict compliance by employees with their instructions and at the same time "suck" creative
                        energy out of them instead of mobilizing it.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of the broad set of requirements for leaders, we consider the two most important ones to be
                        particularly useful: the ability to work with followers and the ability to make decisions based
                        on intuition.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Strengthening the leader's position in the team and his ability to communicate positively with
                        the staff largely depend on his relationships with followers and the correct choice of means of
                        motivating them (not spontaneously, but according to a purposeful program). But the same
                        situation also shows the dependence of the leader on the interested and voluntary response of
                        employees. Being a manager does not promise leadership in itself. Therefore, there is a need to
                        find managers who understand that their behavior in all respects should be interactive, taking
                        into account feedback from subordinates.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The management team is, therefore, an education in which innovative technologies should be
                        introduced.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The characteristic features of an effective innovative management team can be highlighted:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>consideration of the characteristics and qualifications of each team member;</span></li>
                        <li><span>complementarity of skills and capability to perform different role functions;</span></li>
                        <li><span>understanding and acceptance of tasks by all team members;</span></li>
                        <li><span>interest in the constant multiplication and possibly full realization of their creative
                        potential;</span></li>
                        <li><span>fast adaptation to changing conditions and requirements;</span></li>
                        <li><span>reasonableness and satisfaction with team relationships;</span></li>
                        <li><span>analysis of joint actions and discovering collective self-awareness and openness;</span></li>
                        <li><span>development of alternative solutions and selection of the most appropriate one based on common
                        agreement;</span></li>
                        <li><span>complementarity — everyone pays attention and support to each other, marks their achievements,
                        and openly expresses their feelings and doubts;</span></li>
                        <li><span>search for ways to resolve emerging problems (there are no thoughts of suppressing those who
                        hold a different position);</span></li>
                        <li><span>respect for the opinions of your colleagues.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This approach identifies and implements existing opportunities to compensate for the qualities
                        that some employees lack with the qualities of others, which favors their psychological
                        compatibility and the formation of an active team. The distribution area of formal relations is
                        narrowing in innovation management.
