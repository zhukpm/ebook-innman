Often relevance, as well as completeness, is associated with commercial value of information.

It is determined by the extent to which it fairly reflects the socio-economic and other parameters of the object in question.

The level of objectivity of information decreases as it passes through communication channels. The state of affairs may be distorted to an extent that makes the decisions made on the basis of such information more or less worthless.

The timeliness and speed with which information reaches the user is the most important characteristic of its value. As new data becomes available, information loses its usefulness and becomes of little, if not no use at all.

                                <div class="ru-semantics">the ratio of the cost of information to the results obtained from its use should be rational. Any information is costly to obtain and, as a rule, the higher the quality, the more expensive it is to collect, process and store. It is desirable that with the least amount of primary data and the least cost the information contains the maximum amount of useful information. An acceptable balance should be found between the cost and value of the information used.
