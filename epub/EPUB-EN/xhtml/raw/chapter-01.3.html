                            This sphere is represented by civil society institutions. It performs the function of consolidating, declaring and then lobbying the interests of professional, demographic, national, confessional, social, political, etc. structures of the organization of society.

                        In its simplest definition, civil society is a set of formal and informal organizations and rules (institutions) that connect an individual or family (household) with the state (government) and business (private sector of economy). A distinctive feature of civil society organizations is their non-profit (non-commercial) nature and voluntary participation of citizens in these organizations, which is expressed in work without pay or with a salary lower than in the commercial sector.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Civil society occupies a position between the state and the household. It is represented by organized groups and associations that are separate from the state and have a certain autonomy in relations with it, and is voluntarily formed by members of society in order to protect, maintain and spread their values, and to ensure a balance of interests with business and government.<span class="footnote">4</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Institutions of collective behavior greatly facilitate a person's orientation in the world around them and help them adapt to it. Over time, people begin to internally value participation in such institutions, almost regardless of the goods they bring. These include non-profit public organizations united by the concept of the "third sector", which seems to be opposed to the state and is the sphere of implementation of private interests and projects of citizens. It is formed on the principle of self-government as a result of the activity of citizens from below.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The functions of civil society include:
                        - representing the interests of citizens;
                        - involving citizens in social processes;
                        - providing of social services.

                    </p>

                        <li><span>представление интересов граждан;</span></li>
                        <li><span>вовлечение граждан в социальные процессы;</span></li>
                        <li><span>оказание социальных услуг.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Civil society can be interpreted as an independent system that does what the state (government) and business could not or did not want to do, but interacts with them in order to defend the interests of the population.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Russian literature, the phenomenon of civil society is interpreted in different ways, in particular, as:
                        - a human communion at a certain stage of development, including voluntarily formed non-state structures in the economic, political, social and spiritual spheres of society live activity;
                        - a set of non-state economic, political, social, family, national, spiritual, religious, moral and other relations;
                        - a sphere of self-manifestation of free individuals and voluntarily formed organizations and associations of the population, protected by laws from direct interference and arbitrary regulation of their activities by state authorities.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The fundamental condition for the life activity of civil society is the possession by each member of a certain property or participation in the possession of it, the right to use it and dispose of it at their discretion. As noted in this regard the famous Russian Thinker I. A. Ilyin, "the idea of private property is not arbitrarily invented by crafty and greedy people... On the contrary, it is embedded in man and suggested to him by nature itself, just as the individual body and individual instinct are given to man by nature. Therefore, this is a natural human right, which should be protected by laws, law and order and state power".<span class="footnote">5</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important condition for the functioning of civil society is also the presence of a developed, diverse social structure that reflects the richness and diversity of interests of representatives of various groups and strata. With a "blurred" social structure, the individual is directly connected to the state, and this significantly restricts the exercise of his personal rights and freedoms.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A necessary prerequisite for the life activity of civil society is a sufficiently high level of social, intellectual, and psychological development of the individual, his inner freedom and ability to be fully independent when included in a particular social institution.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In developed countries, due to the high development of civil society, the degree of protection of individual and public spheres of life from the arbitrariness of the market and excessive regulation by the state significantly increases. Civil society forms a modern practice of institutionalizing the interests that arise in society and expressing them in a civilized form, within the framework of the Constitution and other laws of the state.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Civil society exists and functions in contradictory unity with the state. In a democratic regime, it is closely connected and interacts with the state; in authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, it is in passive or active opposition to the state.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Civil society is a self-organizing and self-developing system. However, experience shows that it functions and develops much more successfully when favorable internal and external conditions are created for this purpose. To a large extent, they are created by society itself through the state, and often in spite of it. In this regard, civil society and the state are forced to interact with each other, developing mutually acceptable live activity conditions.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In modern conditions, civil society and its institutions, and above all self-regulating structures, play an increasing role in the life activity of society and the national economy. Moreover, they have become an integral part of a mixed, socially oriented national economy. However, it should be noted that the phenomenon of "mixing" is sometimes interpreted in domestic and foreign sources only from the position of the presence of the state and private sectors of the economy in it and their inherent institutions for regulating economic and social processes. This kind of mixing has actually occurred to some extent at all stages of the formation and development of the national economy. However, the modern field of mixing has expanded significantly.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A mixed economy is a qualitative state of the economic system that allows for multi-subject, multiple ways and methods of regulating economic and social processes (relations), as well as many forms of ownership and management.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mixing primarily is manifested and realized that the market mechanism of self-regulation is complemented, on the one hand, conscious of the influence of state institutions on the economic and social processes, where the market gives "misfire", and on the other effective reaction of the institutions of civil society not only "misfires" of the market, but also to the failures of state authorities and manage their corrective.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mixed economy, the researchers note, relies primarily on the price system for its organization, but also uses a variety of government intervention to cope with macroeconomic instability and market shortcomings. Moreover, the mixed system of free enterprise provides for economic control by both society and private institutions. The mixed economy by its very nature necessitates the constant search and use of the most effective forms of interaction between government, business and society.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the economy of developed capitalist countries is developing as a mixed economy. However, national models of mixed economy have their own specifics. Each of them differs not only in the scale of the impact on economic and social processes, but also in the quality of this impact, which, as a rule, means the dependence of its effectiveness on the nature and organization of state institutions and the ways in which they function. At the same time, the functions of the state are important, not the share of state expenditures in the country's budget.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Add to this the growing importance of the impact of civil society organizations on the development of these processes.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the economic sphere, the structural elements of civil society are self-organizing structures of producers and employers (associations and unions of entrepreneurs), consumers (consumer unions, consumer cooperatives and their associations), trade unions, and other voluntary associations of citizens created by them on their own initiative in order to consolidate and lobby for their specific socio-economic interests.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In modern Russia, civil society and its fundamental institutions are in their infancy. Russian citizens do not yet see the state as a system of serving the interests of society, controlled by it and responsible to it. Therefore, even in well-founded state decisions, people tend to see, first of all, the interests of the state apparatus, and not concern for the public good. One of the main reasons for this is that the regime of constant dialogue and interaction between the state (primarily executive) authorities and society is not well established.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modern management methods involve not only information openness of the authorities, for example, through the use of such an institution as electronic-government, but also the involvement of the public in the decision-making and implementation processes. However, management methods have not changed from methods of influence to methods of interaction between managers and the managed. There are almost not used in Russia appropriate organizational forms that are widely used in democratic systems (public expertise of major programs and projects, public investigations, environmental impact assessment, etc.).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Executive power remains "opaque" for control by the emerging civil society, for public initiatives. There are a large number of fundamental state decisions that are made behind closed doors, and the system of distribution and spending of budget funds is far from transparent.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The increased activeness of the life activity of civil society makes it increasingly clear that the state should not regulate the daily work, business, creative and other activities of its citizens. In a developed civil society, the functions of the state are focused on:
                        - developing a common development strategy;
                        - determining and justifying the priorities, rates, and proportions of the development of the economic and social spheres of society;
                        - stimulating socially useful activities of citizens;
                        - protecting their rights, property, and personal dignity;
                        - the democratization of all spheres of life activity of the people;
                        - protecting borders and ensuring the necessary internal order.

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>выработке общей стратегии развития;</span></li>
                        <li><span>определении и обосновании приоритетов, темпов, пропорций развития экономической и
                            социальной сфер общества;</span>

                        <li><span>стимулировании общественно-полезной деятельности граждан;</span></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Due to these circumstances, the process of forming civil society institutions requires full support from the state if it is practically striving for a democratic orientation of its development. A mature civil society makes it possible to effectively solve people's pressing problems. The quality of their daily life directly depends on the quality of the socio-political system. In order to stimulate the growth of civil society institutions, it is necessary to gradually transfer to the non-state sector functions that the state should not or cannot effectively perform.

                            Thus, each of the four main spheres of society's life activity (spiritual, industrial-economic, social and political, and governmental) must perform its inherent functions.

                        The spiritual sphere forms and reproduces the values inherent in the people of Russia. The main function of the industrial-economic sphere is to meet the material needs of society as a whole and each individual individually. The sphere of social and political activity performs the function of consolidation, Declaration and subsequent lobbying of the interests of professional, demographic, national, confessional, social and political structures of the organization of society. The governmental sphere guarantees a balance of interests of subjects of industrial-economic, social and political and governmental activities, as well as provides General conditions for the effective functioning and development of all the main spheres of society's life activity.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, there is a certain division of labor between the main spheres of society's life activity. If it is violated, then there are collisions. There may even be a general nationalization. They can be politicized, i.e. subordinated to the goals and interests of individual classes, social or even professional groups, a political party or movement, which is completed in totalitarianism. It is possible to "economization" of all spheres of life activity to the detriment of spiritual, social, political, and national factors of social development.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All these areas together form an integral system of society's life activity and are in a state of constant interaction. The scope of this interaction is very broad, but it primarily affects the socio-political and economic interests of the parties.
