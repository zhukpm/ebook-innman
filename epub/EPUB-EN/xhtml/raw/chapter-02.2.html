                            The concept of "novation" (from <span class="font-it">innovation</span>) means the process
                            of creating, distributing and using in economic and other systems novelties that have (in
                            comparison with existing analogues) the ability to ensure more efficient operation of the
                            organization, focused on meeting certain needs. Innovation is largely the result of
                            scientific and technological progress and is applied in any spheres as an improvement that
                            allows you to achieve cost savings or create appropriate prerequisites for this.

                        The concept of "innovation" is used in relation to new products and services, methods of their
                        production, novelties (ideas and techniques) in the organization of management activities, and
                        other useful improvements. The innovation process covers the cycle of operations from the origin
                        of the idea to its practical implementation. Innovations are focused on meeting the demand of
                        consumers and are implemented in a market economy mainly by entrepreneurial structures to solve
                        production and commercial problems, ensure the stability of their functioning, economic growth
                        and competitiveness.

                    <p>
                        For ease of understanding and use in practice, it is customary to classify innovations (as well
                        as innovation activities) according to various characteristics or functions.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are basis innovations (major inventions) that become the basis for the formation of new
                        generations (directions) of technology; improving innovations that involve positive changes;
                        rationalizing innovations aimed at partially improving outdated generations of equipment and
                        technologies.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Innovations may differ by sphere of activity:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>product (technological) innovations aimed at creating new or upgrading already producing products;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>production innovations focused on expanding production capacity and diversifying production activities;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>trade innovations aimed at modification in trade activity, pricing policy, offering related services, improving the system and methods of marketing products.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        From the position of the impact on consumers and producers of innovation (the consumer of new
                        goods, services and their producer), an innovative product is considered as the implementation
                        of a creative concept (discovery, invention), in which three components can be distinguished:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>need liable to be met (set of functions which to be performed);</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>new idea (concept) about objects that is able to realize a specific need;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>the set of available knowledge, materials and available technologies that allow you to bring the conception to working condition. A product-novation is a product of scientific, technical and innovation activity that offers a new mean for the consumer or technology for the production of goods and services, opening up new spheres of implementation of needs. The impact of innovation on the producer of goods and services can be assessed through the degree of its novelty for the industrial enterprise; the nature of the concept on which the innovation is based; the intensity of innovation.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The most widely used classification of innovations covers the product, process, and strategy of
                        innovation activity.

                            In general, innovation means creating value in order to get capability for better meet the
                            changing needs of customers, increase the number of consumers, and create new markets for
                            the organization. In all these areas (strategy, process, product), there are many
                            opportunities for innovation, and they are constantly changing and growing.

                        Strategic innovation involves revising existing in the industry methods of creating value for
                        consumers in order to meet the newly emerged needs of clients increase the value of products,
                        create new markets and new consumer groups, new approaches to marketing or advertising the
                        products (services) offered, introduce new sales methods, and improve the customer service
                        system.

                        The innovation of the process is not visible to the consumer and does not directly affect it. It
                        reduces costs, increases labor productivity and the organization's profitability. Organizations
                        use innovations to introduce modern production methods and technologies.

                    <p>
                        Innovation of a product-a commodity or raw material (extending to literally all types of
                        products - from toothpaste to steel beams, from computers to glue, from a jet plane to a car and
                        soybeans) is expressed in every operation that creates new value. These include paid services
                        (merchant, medical, hotel, and other businesses).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All these innovations (strategy, process, and product) are divided into incremental, significant
                        and breakthrough innovations, depending on how much they add value to the product or create new
                        value for the consumer<span class="footnote">10</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An incremental is considered innovation that have a small impact on the increase in the
                        organization's net profit, but it is valuable because it increases customer satisfaction with
                        the product. Another thing is a significant innovation that creates great opportunities to meet
                        the needs of the consumer, helping the actual growth and development of the organization.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scope of innovations action is so broad that it is not limited to new products and new
                        technologies. The understanding of innovation is becoming more and more broad and is equated
                        with strategy. A talented management-innovator can transform into a strategic innovation any
                        type of product-process, especially one that addresses the immediate needs of the client.
                        Innovative business-models are also included into the practice.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In principle, strategic innovation should be based on new technologies. However, this is not an
                        absolute rule. For example, a strategic innovation of a number of airlines is based on the fact
                        that passengers are offered low fares in exchange for refusing such amenities as pre-selection
                        of seats on the plane, meals on Board, non-stop flights, the ability to book a ticket through an
                        Agency, and other services that increase the cost of the ticket. For some companies, the
                        strategic innovation is the system of retail sales through large warehouses.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following types of innovations deserve special attention:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
