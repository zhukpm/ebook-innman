                        The innovation goal is to focus the organization's activities on creating a certain novation,
                        implemented in a given time frame with available (usually limited) resources, in order to
                        significantly improve the quality of development of the innovation object (solving the
                        corresponding problem situation). Innovation goals that involve the development of fundamental
                        novations can be linked to patenting and licensing, the acquisition of know-how and industrial
                        designs, and the life cycle of innovation.

                    <p>
                        These goals cover the entire management structure and are classified according to various
                        criteria, the main of which can be recognized as the following:

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>level of decision-making (strategic and tactical - branch and enterprise);</span></li>
                        <li><span>type of environment in relation to the organization (internal and external);</span></li>
                        <li><span>content (economic, scientific, technical, organizational, etc.);</span></li>
                        <li><span>validity period (long -, medium -, and short-term);</span></li>
                        <li><span>functions (production, scientific researches, design and experimental work, finance,
                        marketing, personnel);</span></li>
                        <li><span>stages of the organization's (project, program) life cycle — emergence, growth, maturity,
                        decline, and completion of the life cycle. </span></li>

                    <p>
                        Each innovative organization has its own system of goals, which are determined to a decisive
                        extent by the influence of the external environment and the internal needs of its development.
                        From the point of view of internal needs, priority innovation goals are to strengthen
                        competitive advantages, increase production efficiency and improve the system of services
                        provided to consumers by increasing the scientific and technical, organizational, intellectual
                        and economic potential of the organization. Its social goals are mainly to increase the wages
                        (remuneration) of employees, improve working conditions and increase the social security of
                        staff.

                        In large organizations, the structuring of innovation activity is accompanied by the
                        construction of a "goal tree".

                        An essential methodological aspect that is important for understanding innovation management is
                        the awareness of the significance and role of external and internal factors that affect the
                        process of its formation, as well as the functioning of the innovation business environment.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many external environmental factors, in turn, can be combined into two groups:


                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>directly affecting the work of the organization-laws and institutions of state regulation;
                        suppliers of materials, equipment, energy, components; consumers of products; competitors
                        (manufacturers of similar products); trade, financial and other intermediaries;</span></li>
                        <li><span>indirectly influencing the organization's work — the state of the economy, scientific and
                        technological progress, political, environmental, cultural factors, etc.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        External factors cause changes in the organization, which are expressed in its reorganization
                        (engineering), quick response to external influences, and adjustment of organizational
                        structures.
